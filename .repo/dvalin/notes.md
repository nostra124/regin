# regin — agent notes

This file is the agent's scratch space: decisions, quirks, constraints, and
open questions discovered while working. It is **never overwritten by the
toolchain**. Read it at the start of every session; append to it at the end.

## Standing rules (settled — do not relitigate)
- **Roadmap = the collective milestone files. There is intentionally NO
  `ROADMAP.md`.** The roadmap is the set of `MILESTONE-*.md` files under
  `.repo/project/issues/`, read together. Do **not** propose, create, or ask
  about a `ROADMAP.md`. (Same convention as dvalin.)
- **`.repo/dvalin/` is the workflow-engine's per-repo area** (notes, decisions,
  engine instructions) — named after the engine (dvalin), NOT after the repo.
  Same in every repo dvalin manages. Never use `.repo/<reponame>/`.
- **regin's own per-repo additions live OUTSIDE the repo.** Anything regin adds
  for a repo — additional memories, special skills, context/instructions — is
  stored in regin's XDG store (SQLite), **keyed by the repo's filesystem path**,
  never committed into the repo. The repo only carries `.repo/dvalin/` +
  `.repo/project/`. (See FEAT-008.)

## How to use this file
- Append new findings under a dated heading; never silently rewrite history.
- Record *why* a non-obvious decision was made, not just *what*.
- Park deferred work as a ticket in `.repo/project/issues/`, then note it here.

## Project quick facts
- Rust workspace, edition 2024: `regin-core` (lib), `regind` (daemon), `regin-cli` (`regin` binary).
- Thin-client CLI ↔ `regind` daemon over a Unix socket; daemon auto-starts on first use.
- All state in SQLite (`<XDG_DATA_DIR>/regin/regin.db`). **No config files** — `regin config set ...`.
- LLM access is via the NanoGPT API; the CLI holds no LLM logic.
- Tools available to the agent loop: `bash`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `web_search`.
- Skills resolve user-over-system: `~/.config/regin/skills/` overrides `/usr/share/regin/skills/`.
- Chat loads per-repo context + memories + skills from regin's XDG store, keyed
  by repo path (FEAT-008). Legacy in-repo `.repo/regin/context.md` is being retired.

## Methodology
- This repo follows the V-Model methodology in `.repo/project/skills/`. Start at
  [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) and the profile at `.repo/project/profile.md`.
- Tickets live under `.repo/project/issues/` (FEAT / BUG / DISC / AUDT). One
  ticket → one PR → one merge commit.

## Open questions / watch-list
- README's "CLI Commands" table is **out of date** vs. the actual clap surface in
  `regin-cli/src/main.rs` (e.g. it lists `regin skill ...` but the verb is
  `regin task ...`, and omits `memory` / `ping`). Reconcile when touching docs.

## Session log
<!-- Append: ## YYYY-MM-DD — <slug> ... -->

### 2026-06-29 — FEAT-027: Portability verbs memory export/import (0.6.0)
- **FEAT-027 implemented and moved to done/.** Three new portability verbs:
  - `regin memory export <path>` — `VACUUM INTO` creates a consistent compact
    snapshot; stamps `exported_from` (hostname) and `exported_at` (timestamp)
    in the snapshot's `identity_meta`.
  - `regin memory import <path> [--merge]` — opens the snapshot, checks
    `identity_id` collision: different identity → refuse; same identity without
    `--merge` → refuse with hint; same identity with `--merge` → INSERT OR
    IGNORE all memories from the snapshot (18-column copy with
    `params_from_iter` since `params!` caps at 16).
  - `regin memory info` — surfaces identity_id, name, host, schema_version,
    memory_count, created_at.
  - Daemon dispatch + protocol Request/Response variants wired.
  - 250 total tests pass, clippy-clean.

### 2026-06-29 — FEAT-026: Vector/embedding recall (0.6.0)
- **FEAT-026 implemented and moved to done/.** Hybrid FTS5 + embedding recall:
  - `MimirClient::embedding()` → calls `/v1/embeddings`, returns `Vec<f32>`.
  - `cosine_similarity()` — deterministic unit tests with fixed vectors.
  - `hybrid_search_ranked()` — merges FTS5 BM25 candidates + cosine-similarity
    vector candidates, reranks by unified activation, reinforces hits.
  - `store_memory_embedding()` / `memories_pending_embedding()` — BLOB
    persistence and backfill plumbing.
  - Daemon: MemorySearch computes query embedding (best-effort) then calls
    `hybrid_search_ranked`; MemorySave/MemoryUpdate fire-and-forget embedding
    via `state_embed_memory`; `run_curation` backfills up to 10 per pass.
  - Config: `memory.embeddings.enabled` (default true), `memory.embeddings.model`
    (default "auto").
  - Graceful fallback: embedding failure or disabled → FTS-only
    `memory_search_ranked`, no crash.
  - 7 new tests covering cosine similarity, embedding persistence, pending
    detection, hybrid semantic match, FTS fallback, host scoping, reinforcement.
  - Critical design decision: MutexGuard must NOT be held across `.await` in
    `run_curation`; use block scoping (`{ let idb = ...; ... }`) to drop the
    guard before any `.await`.
  - 250 total tests pass, clippy-clean.

### 2026-06-29 — FEAT-025: Activation-ranked retrieval (0.6.0)
- **FEAT-025 implemented and moved to done/.** Replaced the old `LIKE`-based
  `memory_search` with FTS5 BM25 + activation reranking:
  - `memory_search_ranked()`: FTS5 MATCH candidate selection, activation score =
    f(BM25 * 10 + recency_score + retrieval_count*0.1 + trust_score*5 + strength*2).
  - Self-reinforcing: each returned hit bumps `retrieval_count` and `last_retrieved`.
  - Host-scoped: `host IS NULL OR host = ?` filters per-machine memories.
  - `context_memories()`: activation-ranked with pinned-first ordering and
    configurable budget, used in `build_context` for the system prompt.
  - Daemon: MemorySearch dispatch uses `memory_search_ranked`; `build_context` uses
    `context_memories` with budget=50 + hostname scope.
  - 5 new tests covering FTS matching, reinforcement, host scoping, pinned-first
    ordering, and budget. 231 total workspace tests pass, clippy-clean.

### 2026-06-29 — FEAT-024: Consolidation pipeline (Curator) (0.6.0)
- **FEAT-024 implemented and moved to done/.** Full Curator pipeline replacing the old
  simple reflection (FEAT-005/006) with DISC-017 tiered consolidation:
  - New types: `CuratorAction` (Add/Update/Delete/Noop), `CuratorProposal` (with
    `target_id`, `topic`, `tags`), `CuratorStats` in types.rs.
  - New identity_db functions: `memory_promote()` (medium→long at threshold),
    enhanced `memory_decay()` (medium decays faster, long only at low strength),
    `topic_ensure()`, `topic_update_summary()`, `topic_list()`,
    `transcript_unconsolidated()`, `curator_apply_proposal()` (handles all 4 actions).
  - New reflect.rs functions: `curation_prompt()` (now includes sessions),
    `parse_curator_proposals()`, `apply_curation()` (interference resolution),
    `gather_curation_inputs()`, `mark_consolidated()`,
    `post_curation_maintenance()` (promote + decay + prune).
  - Daemon: `run_curation()` replaces `run_reflection()`, releases DB lock around
    LLM call. `reflection_checker` now logs full CuratorStats.
  - Backward-compatible: `ReflectionProposal`, `apply_reflection()`, `reflect_once()`
    retained for simpler use cases.
  - 48 new tests across identity_db (14) + reflect (8) covering all actions, tiers,
    topics, transcripts, and maintenance. 226 total workspace tests pass, clippy-clean.

### 2026-06-28 — FEAT-022: migrate episodes + memories to identity.db (0.6.0)
- **FEAT-023 implemented and moved to done/.** Session archival + transcript capture.
  Extended `sessions` schema with `host`, `kind`, `title`, `message_count`,
  `token_count`, `state`, `transcript_text` (dropped `episode_id` — episode FK now
  goes `episodes.ref_id → sessions.id`). Added `session_open()`,
  `session_open_with_id()`, `transcript_append()`, `session_close()`, `session_list()`,
  `session_get()`, `hostname()` to identity_db.rs. Added `SessionRow`,
  `SessionWithTranscript`, `TranscriptMessage` types. Wired into daemon: `ChatNew`
  opens a session, `ChatSend` appends user/assistant messages and closes on completion
  with a title-based summary. 9 new tests (30 total identity_db tests). 206 workspace
  tests pass, clippy-clean.

- **FEAT-022 implemented and moved to done/.** All memory/episode CRUD functions
  mirrored in `identity_db.rs` (memory_list/search/save/update/delete, memory_list_for_repo,
  etc.) — 27 tests. Added `ref_id` column to identity.db episodes table. Wired identity_db
  into daemon: `AppState.identity_db`, startup init + migration, dispatch handlers,
  `build_context`, `run_reflection` all redirect to identity_db for memory/episode ops.
  reflect.rs uses `identity_db::*` instead of `db::*`. 21 identity_db tests + 5 regind
  dispatch tests + full workspace tests pass. Clippy-clean (pre-existing warnings only).

### 2026-06-28 — FEAT-021: identity.db store + schema bootstrap (0.6.0 foundation)
- **FEAT-021 implemented and moved to done/.** New `regin-core/src/identity_db.rs`
  module with `init_identity_db(path)`, `init_identity_schema(conn)`, and `meta_get()`.
  Full DISC-017 schema: `identity_meta` (key/value seeded on first bootstrap),
  episodic tier (`episodes` with `kind`/`host`/`importance`/`state`, `sessions`,
  `transcripts`), long-term tier (`topics` with hierarchy, `memories` with
  `topic_id`/`tier`/`host`/`embedding`/`trust_score`), FTS5 virtual tables
  (`memories_fts`, `transcripts_fts`) with `ai`/`ad`/`au` sync triggers, and 9
  indexes. Added `identity_db_path()` to config.rs; exposed `pub mod identity_db`
  in lib.rs. No Cargo.toml changes needed (FTS5 ships in bundled SQLite by default).
  11 unit tests covering idempotency, table/trigger/index creation, FTS sync, and
  file-backed open/reopen. 187 total workspace tests pass, clippy-clean (pre-existing
  clippy errors in llm.rs/db.rs/tools.rs are unchanged).

### 2026-06-19 — DISC-017 opened (portable identity vs machine apparatus)
- **New orthogonal axis (corrected with user):** *identity* (portable, travels with
  the agent) vs *machine apparatus* (local, rebuilt per box). Distinct from the
  operator/foreman plane axis. Identity = self-improving memory (archived sessions,
  documented transcripts, topic-based knowledge summaries, distilled semantic
  memory) in its **own SQLite DB**, copyable container→container. Machine apparatus
  = ITIL records (incident/change/problem/KPI), **audit results**, local
  tools/skills/docs, desired-state/filters/derived-checks — stays in `regin.db` +
  files on the box.
- **Audit is apparatus, NOT identity.** `operations/audit.md` + DISC-016 self-audit
  execute rules and raise ITIL incidents bound to the machine; nothing to do with
  self-improvement. Do not conflate.
- **"Hermes" = external reference project** (NousResearch hermes-agent), the
  *inspiration* for the memory design — not a regin subsystem. DISC-002/FEAT-006's
  internal "Hermes" nickname is loose; not rewritten (shipped tickets are immutable
  per audit rule). New subsystem name is a DISC-017 open question.
- **Current state violates the split:** DISC-002 → FEAT-005 (episodic) + FEAT-006
  (semantic reflection) put memory in the *same* `regin.db` as ITIL/runs/settings.
  DISC-017 reconsiders where that store lives AND extends it (sessions/transcripts/
  topic knowledge), which DISC-002 never covered.
- DISC-017 filed **open/pending** (decision via guided Q&A, like DISC-008/016).
  Open questions: boundary (where do chats/runs fall?), store shape (2nd SQLite vs
  files+index vs hybrid), topic-knowledge schema + consolidation pipeline,
  portability mechanics (export/import verb, identity id, relation to DISC-003 dwarf
  identity), machine-scoped knowledge, migration off `regin.db`, naming.

### 2026-06-19 — DISC-009 decided (three-lane remediation guardrail)
- **Q1 mechanism = Hybrid (H):** capability ceiling + declarative safe-action
  fast-path + LLM judgement within bounds.
- **Q2 posture = adaptive (earn autonomy):** start conservative; safe-lane
  graduates to auto-apply as change-success / autonomy KPIs prove trust — same
  earn-trust pattern as DISC-015 promotion, same KPI store.
- **Q3 safe-lane gate = rollback plan + dry-run:** auto-apply only if a concrete
  backout/undo is captured *before* applying (snapshot/backup/reversible) with
  bounded blast radius, plus dry-run where supported. Allowlist = fast-path of
  pre-blessed reversible ops.
- **Q4 ceiling = own operator ceiling + minimal static global red-lines.** Operator
  ceiling (editable) does day-to-day work; a tiny non-runtime-adjustable global
  red-line set protects the safety substrate (backups/snapshots/audit/KPI store),
  governance (service stop, escalation channel, kill-switch) and bars catastrophic
  host actions. Rationale: operator ceiling is editable + regin ingests logs
  (prompt-injection surface), so the global layer is defense-in-depth. Note: Q3's
  safe-lane *requires* the "never delete rollback/audit substrate" red-line.

### 2026-06-19 — DISC-015 decided (KPIs + promotion loop) + DISC-016 (self-audit) spawned
- **DISC-015 resolved via guided Q&A.** KPI framework reviewed/expanded first:
  reliability is a **constraint not a currency** (minimise cost s.t. reliability ≥
  floor); north-star = cost ↓ while **time-in-deviation** ↓; added **automation
  ratio** (the direct "senseful full automation" gauge), notice-filter savings,
  cost-avoided, MTTD/MTTR, recurrence, **promotion-error rate**, **autonomy ratio**.
  - Q1 objective = constrained; **all four KPI groups in v1** (schema defined now;
    promotion-error/autonomy KPIs report once their features exist).
  - Q2 surface = CSI summary in the login greeting (DISC-010) + a `regin metrics`
    command; KPIs in SQLite beside ITIL records.
  - Q3 promotion = **autonomous + audit trail**; criteria are **regin-owned and
    self-adapting**, grounded in *both* N-consistent+confidence and a statistical
    error-bound; governed by the promotion-error KPI, safety-netted by demotion.
  - Q5 notice filters = regin-managed, hand-editable **rule files** in a dedicated
    filters store (separate from `desired/`).
  - Q6 promoted checks = a **separate machine-managed derived-checks store** that
    references the to-be-state (not written into the human-authored structured
    layer); scheduler (DISC-013) runs them.
- **DISC-016 — periodic operator self-audit (NEW, from DISC-015 Q4).** Demotion is
  just one function: a regular (e.g. monthly) wide-lens CSI review that re-judges
  promoted checks, reviews KPI trends, tunes promotion criteria + notice filters,
  checks to-be-state drift, and files findings as ITIL artefacts (heavier actions
  via the DISC-009 approval gate). Immediate demotion on real-world
  contradiction/override stays in DISC-015. Cadence/scope/authority/cost-ceiling
  are its open questions.

### 2026-06-19 — DISC-008 resolved + DISC-015 (monitoring economics) spawned
- **DISC-008 (to-be state) closed via guided Q&A:**
  - **Three-layer target:** explicit markdown (intent) + structured assertions
    (machine-checkable) + implicit monitor-skill thresholds. They must agree —
    **deviation from target → incident**; **conflict *within* the target →
    problem** (the definition is ambiguous, needs a human).
  - **Stored as files, like skills** (not SQLite) — a scoped, deliberate exception
    to "all state in SQLite": desired-state is authored *content*, so it follows
    the skills precedent (`~/.config/regin/desired/` over a possible
    `/etc/regin/desired/`; `regind` is a per-user service). **Per-domain files**
    (`disk.md`, `services.md`, …), mapping 1:1 to the operator skill catalog
    (DISC-012).
  - **Deviation is LLM-judged, not raw events** — not every monitoring event is an
    incident; judging worth-against-intent is the point of the LLM.
- **DISC-015 — adaptive monitoring economics (NEW, spawned from DISC-008 Q4):** the
  ITIL **CSI** loop on regin's own monitoring. Guiding principle = **"senseful full
  automation"** (René's professor): automate fully but only where it makes sense.
  Two tiers (periodic LLM review ↔ cheap hourly deterministic checks); a
  **promotion loop** distils crystal-clear LLM verdicts into deterministic checks
  (land in DISC-008's structured layer; cadence per DISC-013); **notice filters**
  cut tokens before the LLM; reversible **demotion**; and **measurable** metrics
  (cost ↓ over time while reliability ↑, problems ↓). **"Senseful full automation"
  goes into regin's operator-plane system prompt** (baseline operator directive,
  cf. `regin-core/src/context.rs`).

### 2026-06-19 — operator model + operator/foreman plane split (MILESTONE-0.5.0)
- **Two planes (governing framing, near-settled — confirm in guided Q&A):**
  - **Operator plane** — regin as the autonomous operator of the *machine/
    container* it runs on. Governed by ITIL: a declared **to-be state**, and the
    loop deviation→**incident**→**change** (problems are the exception).
    `operator` is a distinct role from `foreman`.
  - **Foreman/repo-worker plane** — regin working *inside a repo* under that
    repo's own methodology (software ≠ marketing campaign), delegating to
    Claude/opencode or acting directly. ITIL does **not** apply here; repo
    methodology does. (To be discussed after the operator plane.)
- **Operator loop (converged with user):** to-be state (explicit markdown +
  implicit monitor thresholds) is the reference. Deviation → incident (always;
  incidents are by-definition solvable). The fix is usually a **change applied
  directly to the incident** (e.g. `/` full → delete temp files). A **problem**
  is raised only on (a) recurrence, or (b) a fix that is out-of-regin's-control
  or destructive. A problem carries hypotheses, may need long-run monitoring, and
  its real fix is a **change out of the problem** (e.g. adjust log rotation).
- **Three-lane risk guardrail == the autonomy policy:** each candidate change is
  judged safe-reversible (**auto-apply**) / uncertain-destructive
  (**`pending_approval`**, ask first) / out-of-control (**problem + escalate**).
- **Escalation routes by runtime mode:** supervisor over the bus if dvalin is
  reachable, else **parked for the human-at-login greeting** (`regin chat` opens
  with health status + the problems/changes it needs help with). Replaces an
  active push channel. Note: mode is currently inferred only from persona config
  and the escalation bridge has no offline fallback — both are gaps.
- Captured as **DISC-008** (to-be state), **DISC-009** (remediation + guardrail),
  **DISC-010** (mode-routed escalation + login greeting), **DISC-011** (ITIL model
  extensions: incident `blocked`+workaround, `change.problem_id`, change
  `pending_approval`, problem hypotheses; drop redundant `incidents.problem_id`).
  Still to open: DISC-012 operator skill catalog, DISC-013 scheduling+resilience,
  DISC-014 apk/rpm. All under MILESTONE-0.5.0; resolving open sub-questions via
  guided Q&A before minting FEATs.

### 2026-06-17 — methodology install
- Ported the dvalin V-Model methodology into this repo: `AGENTS.md`,
  `.repo/project/skills/` (canonical, verbatim), `.repo/project/audit/rules/`,
  an empty `.repo/project/issues/` ticket scaffold, and a regin-specific
  `.repo/project/profile.md`. No dvalin work-tickets were copied.

### 2026-06-17 — MILESTONE-0.2.0 planned (operations discipline)
- Verified items 1–6 of the operations request already exist in code (config in
  SQLite, `config list/get/set`, api_key in SQLite, `daemon.enabled` lingering
  systemd service, unrestricted tools). Only real gap: `ensure_daemon()` spawns a
  loose `regind` instead of registering the systemd service → BUG-001.
- Filed the plan as MILESTONE-0.2.0 with DISC-001 (ITIL ops agent), DISC-002
  (Hermes tiered+reflective memory), FEAT-001..007, BUG-001. User decisions:
  Hermes = self-reflective + tiered episodic; ITIL = SQLite records + methodology
  docs; approach = plan-as-milestone first, then one ticket = one PR.
- DISC-003 captures "regin as a dvalin dwarf" (future, not in 0.2.0): recommended
  A→B→C layering — JSON-API ticket escalation → ops executor plugin → dwarf-pool
  membership. Hard constraint: keep regin's LLM inside the executor (dvalin's
  no-LLM engine invariant). Closing DISC-003 spawns FEATs in BOTH repos.
- Nothing implemented yet — next step is to start the milestone, foundation
  tickets first (FEAT-002 data model, FEAT-005 episodic tier).

### 2026-06-19 — Identity plane finalized through 0.6.0 (DISC-017 resolved, DISC-018 added, FEAT-021..032 minted)
- **DISC-017 RESOLVED** (was logged open/pending above). Decision: portable
  `identity.db` (Variant A), 4-tier memory model (working/episodic/medium/long),
  topic-indexed long-term knowledge, activation-ranked FTS **+ vector** recall
  (scoped override of DISC-002's embedding deferral, memory-plane only), active
  decay + interference resolution; per-host `host` column travels with the identity
  but injects only on the matching host; **move-and-delete** migration off
  `regin.db`. Subsystem name = **memory plane**; verbs under `regin memory …`.
  Spawned **FEAT-021..027**.
- **DISC-018 NEW + resolved — decision plane** (`Persona / Mind / Soul / Body`):
  - **Sharp glossary (load-bearing):** Persona = *outward* identity (role/mask,
    FEAT-011); Mind = reasoning (plans/decides); Soul = *inner* identity
    (values-grounded conscience); Body = execution. Dropped the earlier "ego/false
    identity" overload on Mind — Persona is the mask, Soul is the character.
  - **Two modes:** `act` (`Mind → Body`, fast default) vs `deliberate`
    (`Mind ⇄ Soul → Body`: read-only plan, starved Soul votes, approved plan runs).
  - **Q1 trigger = risk-gated**, reusing DISC-009's blast-radius/reversibility
    judgement (+ Persona/urgency modifiers). **Q2 deadlock = Soul veto →
    default-deny + escalate** (FEAT-015/DISC-010). **Q3 grounding = values subset**.
    **Q4 = capture deliberations** (plan+vote+outcome) for calibration. **Q5 =
    principles derived seed + reflection-proposes + human-ratified** (keeps the
    conscience independent of the Mind).
  - **Values model = core + per-role overlay** (decided with user): persistent
    identity-core values in `identity.db` (portable) ∪ active Persona's overlay in
    `persona.toml` (swappable). The Soul votes from the union.
  - **Soul configurator (FEAT-030):** bundled value catalog drawn across human
    history/literature (Stoic/cardinal, theological, Confucian, chivalric,
    Enlightenment, Schwartz taxonomy, + agent-operational virtues); `regin soul …`
    CLI seeds the core charter; Persona→values derivation proposes a role-default
    set for human confirmation.
  - Spawned **FEAT-028..032**.
- **MILESTONE-0.6.0 — Identity plane** created (`status: planned`, depends_on 0.5.0),
  grouping the memory plane (021–027) + decision plane (028–032), with delivery
  order + exit criteria. **0.5.0 stays the single active milestone** (RULE-008).
- **Naming collisions avoided:** modes are `act`/`deliberate` (NOT "reflection
  mode" — `reflect.rs` = memory consolidation; `planning.rs` = org cadence).
- **Reminder honoured:** did NOT create a `ROADMAP.md` (standing rule — roadmap =
  the milestone files). Earlier in-session offer to render one was retracted.
- **Still user-gated (discuss-first, NOT auto-finalized):** the 0.5.0 operator
  capability backlog — DISC-009 (decided, to derive), DISC-015 (decided, to
  derive), and open/to-open DISC-008/010/011/012/013/014/016. These need user
  decisions before FEATs; out of scope for "till 0.6" identity-plane finalization.

### 2026-06-19 — Operator plane fully decided (DISC-011/010/016 resolved; DISC-012/013/014 opened + resolved)
- All operator-plane discoveries (DISC-008..016) are now **filed + decided**. MILESTONE
  -0.5.0 table updated to match (several were stale "open"). FEATs not yet minted —
  derive as the 0.5.0 capability batch.
- **DISC-011 (ITIL extensions):** `blocked` = first-class incident status + `workaround`;
  hypotheses = minimal structured rows (text + created→validating→confirmed/rejected);
  recurrence threshold = global default 3 + per-domain override in the to-be-state doc.
  Confirmed: `change.problem_id`, change `pending_approval` + approver/approved_at, drop
  redundant `incidents.problem_id` (keep join). → 2 features.
- **DISC-010 (escalation + greeting):** mode detection = Variant C (effective mode =
  configured target AND recent reachability). Login greeting = actionable items
  (pending-approval changes + problems) + one-line health (counts open incidents).
  **Critical push = opt-in, critical-only, OFF by default, IN v1** (ntfy/webhook/email)
  — user upgraded from my "defer". On bus recovery = auto-flush parked items,
  re-validated. Distinct from FEAT-015 (dev-plane ticket mint vs human decision/approval).
  → 5 features.
- **DISC-016 (periodic self-audit):** Variant A scheduled audit skill. Cadence =
  adaptive (monthly default). Scope = full CSI sweep (demotion, KPI review, criteria
  tuning, filter hygiene, to-be-state drift, coverage), modular per dependency. Output =
  report + ITIL artefacts + summary in `regin metrics`/login greeting. Authority = reuse
  DISC-009 lanes; to-be-state edits ALWAYS need approval. Cost = budgeted; skip/trim is a
  tracked event. → 2 features.
- **DISC-012 (operator skill catalog) — opened + resolved:** anatomy = structured bundle
  (monitor + to-be-state domain file + remediation playbook, fixes tagged for DISC-009
  lanes), one skill per domain. v1 scope = **broad ~12 domains** (disk, services, memory/
  load, logs, security-updates, certificates, backups, network, time-sync, users/auth,
  processes, firewall) — user chose broad over my core-8. Remediation = mixed per-domain
  (remediate disk/services/logs/time-sync/backups/security-updates; monitor-only +
  escalate the rest). Packaging = `regin-operator-skills` system package (3 existing
  report-only skills fold in), user-overridable. → 3 features. Distinct from DISC-007
  (org/role packaging).
- **DISC-013 (scheduling + resilience) — opened + resolved:** cadence = skill-declared
  default + user/config override (+ optional to-be-state per-domain tune); automatic
  jitter. LLM outage/over-budget = exponential backoff + **degrade to DISC-015
  deterministic checks** + self-incident if prolonged. Missed runs = coalesced run-once
  catch-up (staleness-checked). Watchdog = systemd lingering service + internal heartbeat
  + self-incident on repeated skill failure. → 4 features.
- **DISC-014 (apk/rpm) — opened + resolved:** add **both** rpm + apk; build via **nfpm**
  (one config → deb+rpm+apk, replacing the deb-only FEAT-020 recipe); land **in 0.5.0**.
  Consequence: **profile §7 deb-only → deb/rpm/apk first-class** (gate removed); FEAT-020
  reworked to nfpm. → 3 features (nfpm packaging, per-format install PITs, profile §7
  update).
- **Next:** mint the 0.5.0 operator-capability FEATs from DISC-009/010/011/012/013/014/
  015/016 (currently all decided, features listed but not yet ticketed), then sequence
  0.5.0 delivery. profile.md §7 still says deb-only — update when FEAT work starts.

### 2026-06-19 — MILESTONE-0.5.0 fully planned (FEAT-033..059 minted)
- Minted the **operator-capability FEATs (FEAT-033..055)** from the decided operator
  discoveries, and the **release-readiness FEATs (FEAT-056..059)** for the delivery
  prerequisites (install script, wiki, coverage CI gate, release automation).
- **FEAT-020 superseded by FEAT-053** (nfpm folds the deb recipe into one config that
  also builds rpm + apk). Noted in both files + the milestone.
- MILESTONE-0.5.0 reworked: docs/packaging + operator-capability + release-readiness
  issue tables, dependency-ordered delivery plan (foundation→evaluation→skills→
  remediation loop→optimisation→packaging→release), operator-loop exit criteria,
  prerequisites table now all "filed". Intro no longer says "pending discovery".
- 0.5.0 is **fully planned** (every DISC decided, every FEAT minted, no "(file at
  planning)" gaps). Remaining = implementation only (one ticket → one PR, V-Model
  phases). Kept as a single milestone (user: split "does not matter").
- Still pending at IMPLEMENTATION time (not planning gaps): update profile.md §7 to
  deb/rpm/apk (FEAT-053); the milestone is large (~29 FEATs incl. release readiness) —
  split remains an option if desired.

### 2026-07-12 — FEAT-070: CLI transport seam + render/logic split (0.6.0 coverage)
- **FEAT-070 implemented and moved to done/.** New `regin-cli/src/transport.rs`:
  a `Transport` trait (`request` for single round-trips, `request_stream` for
  multi-event exchanges with a live per-event callback) with `SocketTransport`
  (the real Unix-socket implementation — `connect_daemon`/`ensure_daemon`/
  `send_req`/`read_resp` and the daemon-auto-start plumbing all moved here
  verbatim) and a `#[cfg(test)] FakeTransport` (canned replies, records sent
  `Request`s). New `regin-cli/src/render.rs`: ~30 pure `Response -> String`
  render functions (task/memory/ITIL/desired/metrics/audit/etc. listings) plus
  streaming-event helpers (`apply_chat_event`, `render_tool_call`,
  `render_tool_result`, `render_task_result`).
- All ~40 daemon-calling `cmd_*` functions in `main.rs` now take `&impl
  Transport` and call a render fn instead of printing inline. `cmd_chat` and
  `cmd_task_exec` (the two streaming/interactive commands) route through
  `request_stream`'s callback so production output is still live
  (event-by-event) while `FakeTransport` can replay a canned sequence in
  tests. Local-only commands (bus/persona/deputy/skill-install, no daemon
  round-trip) were left as-is.
- **Deliberate simplification:** dropped the old per-segment ANSI colouring
  inside render fns in favour of plain `String` output (colour is now applied
  as a single wrap around the whole rendered block at the call site) — makes
  every render fn a trivial, comparable `String` in tests. Documented in the
  PR; not expected to be missed (the CLI is still coloured, just less
  granularly).
- 64 new tests (66 total in `regin-cli`, up from 2): every render fn has a
  unit test, every daemon-calling `cmd_*` is exercised via `FakeTransport`
  (happy path + an error `Response`), and a `Cli::try_parse_from` sweep covers
  the full command/subcommand/flag surface plus a required-arg-rejection
  check. Full workspace (`cargo build/test/clippy --workspace`) stays green;
  `regin-cli` itself is clippy-clean.
- No `cargo-llvm-cov` available in this sandbox to print an exact percentage —
  precise measurement + the `COVERAGE_MIN` gate ramp is FEAT-075's job once
  072–074 land too.
- Sets up FEAT-071 (injectable `LlmClient`) next, then the decision-plane
  FEATs (028→030→029→032→031), per the milestone's suggested delivery order.

### 2026-07-12 — FEAT-071: Injectable LLM client (0.6.0 coverage)
- **FEAT-071 implemented and moved to done/.** New `LlmClient` trait in
  `regin-core/src/llm.rs` (`#[async_trait]`, object-safe — `dyn LlmClient`)
  covering the surface actually used across the codebase: `chat_turn`,
  `embedding`, and `chat_completion` (default-impl'd in terms of
  `chat_turn`). `chat_completion_stream`/`stream_messages` stayed inherent
  `MimirClient`-only methods — grepped the whole workspace and found zero
  call sites for them anywhere (SSE streaming isn't actually wired up; the
  daemon "streams" by sending the final text as one `StreamChunk` — see
  `agentic_chat`), so they weren't worth trait-ifying.
- `impl LlmClient for MimirClient` delegates to the existing inherent
  methods (`self.chat_turn(...)` inside the impl still resolves to the
  inherent method — Rust always prefers inherent over trait methods for a
  concrete receiver — confirmed not recursive). Zero behaviour change for
  the concrete type.
- **`FakeLlm`** (also in `llm.rs`, *not* `#[cfg(test)]`-gated since `regind`
  — a different crate — needs it in its own tests): independent FIFO queues
  for `chat_turn`/`chat_completion`/`embedding` replies.
- **`AppState.llm_client()`** (regind) changed from constructing a fresh
  `MimirClient` from live config on every call to returning
  `Arc<dyn LlmClient>` — but **kept the fresh-config-read behavior** for the
  production path (a new `llm_override: Option<Arc<dyn LlmClient>>` field on
  `AppState`, `None` in production, short-circuits straight to the injected
  client in tests). Deliberate: a naive "construct once at startup" design
  would have silently broken live `regin config set mimir.*` reconfiguration
  (no daemon restart needed today) — documented in a doc-comment so nobody
  "simplifies" this into `AppState` holding a bare `Arc<dyn LlmClient>` field
  set once at construction.
- `reflect::curate_once`/`reflect::reflect_once`/`skills::run_skill` signatures
  changed `client: &MimirClient` → `&dyn LlmClient` (mechanical; not currently
  called from `regind` — it reimplements curation/reflection inline in
  `run_curation` — so this is forward hygiene, not a behavior change).
- New `regind::dispatch_tests`: `chat_send_uses_the_injected_llm_client` drives
  `Request::ChatNew` → `Request::ChatSend` through the *real* `dispatch()` with
  a `FakeLlm` queued reply and asserts the `StreamChunk`/`StreamDone` carries
  it — no network. `TaskExec` shares the same `agentic_chat` LLM loop (via
  `exec_skill_agentic`), so this one test covers the LLM-dependent code path
  both commands rely on; didn't additionally stand up a temp skills dir to
  drive `TaskExec` literally, since it'd exercise the identical `chat_turn`
  seam for marginal extra coverage.
- Added `async-trait = "0.1"` as a new workspace dependency — required for
  `dyn LlmClient` (native async-fn-in-trait isn't object-safe without it, and
  `AppState` holding a boxed/`Arc` trait object was explicit in the ticket).
- 8 new tests (regin-core: +5 llm_client_trait_tests; regind: +3 dispatch
  tests). Full workspace build/test/clippy stays green.
- Next: the decision-plane FEATs, starting with FEAT-028 (dual-mode agent
  loop), per the milestone's suggested order.

### 2026-07-12 — FEAT-028: Dual-mode agent loop (act vs deliberate) (0.6.0 decision plane)
- **FEAT-028 implemented and moved to done/.** New `regin-core/src/decision.rs`
  — pure-ish engine, same pattern as `remediation.rs`/`safelane.rs` (both of
  which are *also* not wired into `regind`'s live loop yet — confirmed by
  grep, zero call sites in `regind/src/main.rs`). This ticket follows suit
  deliberately: **not wired into `agentic_chat`**. Reasoning captured in the
  module doc comment so it isn't mistaken for an oversight — wiring a
  stub-that-always-approves `SoulGate` into the live chat loop would add a
  new production code path for zero behavioural benefit until FEAT-029 lands
  the real gate. `act` mode (today's `chat_turn` path) is therefore unchanged
  *by construction*, satisfying acceptance criterion 5 without a regression
  test against `agentic_chat` itself.
- **Mode selection:** `ContemplatedAction { reversible, destructive,
  outward_facing, urgent }` + a pluggable `RiskClassifier` trait.
  `DefaultRiskClassifier` mirrors DISC-009's blast-radius/reversibility
  judgement (irreversible/destructive/outward → deliberate; urgency
  overrides to act). `select_mode()` lets a `Persona.default_mode` override
  (new optional field, `"act"`|`"deliberate"`, validated) win outright over
  the classifier.
- **Deliberate pipeline:** `Planner` (async, produces a read-only `Plan` —
  `intent_summary`/`steps`/`intended_tool_calls`, zero side effects) → 
  `SoulGate` (`Approve`/`Revise`/`Veto` + one-line reaction) →
  `Executor` (only reached on `Approve`). `run_deliberate()` loops
  plan→gate up to `max_rounds` (config: `decision.deliberate.max_rounds`,
  default 3; `decision.default_mode`, default `act`), feeding `Revise`'s
  reaction back into the next planning round, and returns
  `DeniedAndEscalated { reason }` on `Veto` or exhausted rounds — the actual
  bus/dvalin escalation I/O (FEAT-015) is the *caller's* job when this gets
  wired up; this module signals it, doesn't perform it.
- `PassthroughSoulGate` (always approves) is the explicit stand-in for
  FEAT-029 — lets FEAT-028 land and be fully tested without a forward
  dependency on the ticket that hasn't been built yet.
- 14 new tests (regin-core 243→257): mode selection with both the real
  classifier and a `FakeClassifier` (acceptance criterion 1), a spy executor
  proving zero executions during planning/veto and exactly-one on approval
  (criteria 2–3), `max_rounds` + persona-override enforcement (criterion 4),
  a `Revise`-feedback round-trip test, and the `Persona.default_mode`
  field's own round-trip/validation tests.
- Full workspace build/test/clippy stays green (fixed one new
  `collapsible_if` clippy lint in `persona.rs`'s validation — everything else
  was pre-existing, untouched).
- Next: FEAT-030 (Soul configurator + value catalog), per the milestone's
  suggested order — lands before FEAT-029 so the real Soul gate has a value
  catalog to vote from when it's built.

### 2026-07-12 — FEAT-030: Soul configurator + value catalog (0.6.0 decision plane)
- **FEAT-030 implemented and moved to done/.** New `regin-core/assets/values.toml`
  (checked-in, versioned, `include_str!`-embedded) — ~37 entries across cardinal/
  Stoic, theological, Confucian, Aristotelian, chivalric, Enlightenment, Schwartz,
  and agent-operational traditions, each with `id`/`name`/`description`/`tradition`.
  New `regin-core/src/soul.rs`: `catalog()`/`find()` (parsed once via `OnceLock`),
  `role_default_values()` (built-in map for cfo/dev-lead/operator/security/foreman/
  auditor + a generic agent-operational-virtue fallback for unknown roles — the
  ticket's "LLM-assisted suggestion for novel roles" was scoped out: the acceptance
  criteria only require a *known* Persona's derive to work, and the deterministic
  fallback is instant/testable vs. a network call for marginal benefit),
  `grounding_union()` (core ∪ overlay, deduplicated, order-stable), and the
  privileged charter read/write path (`charter_seed`/`charter_core_ids`/
  `charter_remove`).
- **Core-charter immutability (acceptance criterion 4) — the trickiest part.**
  `identity_db::memory_update`/`memory_delete`/`curator_apply_proposal` had *zero*
  existing protection for `pinned` or any category — a real latent gap. Added a
  `PRINCIPLE_CATEGORY` guard: those three functions now refuse (Update/Delete →
  `Err`; the curator's Add/Update/Delete → silently `Ok(false)`, consistent with its
  existing "malformed proposal" convention) whenever the target row's category is
  `"principle"`. `soul::charter_seed`/`charter_remove` are the *only* privileged
  bypass — reachable solely from `regin soul charter`. No schema migration: the
  value id is encoded as a `"{id}: ..."` prefix in the memory's `content` (the
  `memories` table has no dedicated column for it, and adding one for a feature
  this narrow wasn't worth a migration).
- **Persona** gains two new optional, backward-compatible fields:
  `values: Vec<String>` (the per-role overlay this ticket needed) — `default_mode`
  was already added by FEAT-028.
- **Full protocol + CLI wiring** (not scoped out, unlike FEAT-028's deliberate
  pipeline): `Request`/`Response` variants (`SoulValuesList/Show`,
  `SoulCharterShow/Derive/Confirm/Remove`), `regind` dispatch arms (careful to
  scope every `identity_db` `MutexGuard` in a block *before* the `send(...).await`
  — the exact bug class flagged in FEAT-024's notes; caught it via a real compile
  error, "future cannot be sent between threads safely", not by memory), and a full
  `regin soul values list|show` / `regin soul charter show|derive|set|remove` CLI
  surface built on FEAT-070's `Transport`/render pattern.
- 34 new tests total: regin-core +17 (soul.rs catalog/derivation/union/charter
  round-trip, identity_db principle-guard enforcement, persona `values` overlay);
  regin-cli +8 (render fns + `FakeTransport`-driven `cmd_soul_*`, `Cli::try_parse_from`
  coverage for the whole `regin soul` tree). Full workspace build/test/clippy green.
- Next: FEAT-029 (the Soul gate itself) — now has both FEAT-028's pipeline
  (`SoulGate` trait, `PassthroughSoulGate` stub to replace) and FEAT-030's value
  catalog + grounding union to vote from.

### 2026-07-12 — FEAT-029: The Soul gate (values-grounded vote + veto) (0.6.0 decision plane)
- **FEAT-029 implemented and moved to done/.** Landed in `decision.rs` (not a
  new module) — it's the real implementation of the `SoulGate` trait FEAT-028
  already defined, so it belongs where that trait and `run_deliberate` live.
- **`SoulGate::evaluate` became `async fn ... -> Result<...>`** (was sync,
  infallible) — a real LLM call is inherently async/fallible. Updated
  `PassthroughSoulGate` and `run_deliberate`'s call site (`.await?`)
  accordingly; this is expected ticket-to-ticket evolution of FEAT-028's
  trait, not a mistake — the trait was always going to need this once a real
  gate showed up.
- **`LlmSoulGate`**: builds exactly two messages — a fixed system prompt
  ("you are the conscience... respond with ONLY a JSON object") and a user
  turn containing **only** `Plan.intent_summary` + the resolved values
  grounding (names/descriptions looked up from FEAT-030's catalog). Verified
  by a `SpyLlm` test double that records every message sent and asserts a
  plan's `steps`, `intended_tool_calls`, and tool names never appear in it —
  acceptance criterion 1, actually enforced by a test rather than just by
  code review.
- **Verdict resolution**: `veto` always wins; `approve` passes only at
  `confidence >= decision.deliberate.confidence_threshold` (new setting,
  default 0.7) — below-threshold `approve` *and* `revise` both resolve to
  `SoulVerdict::Revise`. Response parsing tolerates prose wrapped around the
  JSON object (LLMs don't reliably honour "ONLY JSON" — same lenient
  `{...}`-extraction pattern `reflect.rs`'s curator parsing already uses) and
  a genuinely malformed response is a hard `Err`, not a silent approve.
- **`SoulVote` + `VoteRecorder` trait + `NullVoteRecorder` stub** — same
  "define the seam, stub the sink" pattern as FEAT-028's `PassthroughSoulGate`.
  FEAT-032 ("deliberation capture") owns turning this into durable storage;
  FEAT-029's job was making sure every vote (`plan_id`, `confidence`,
  `verdict`, `gut_reaction`) is *produced* and handed to *something* —
  verified with a `SpyRecorder` capturing all 3 votes across a 3-round
  `max_rounds` exhaustion.
- `run_deliberate` itself needed **no changes** for criteria 3/4 (veto /
  max-rounds → `DeniedAndEscalated`) — that logic was already correct from
  FEAT-028; this ticket's tests just exercise it end-to-end through the real
  gate instead of a canned `FixedVerdictSoul`.
- Added `decision.deliberate.confidence_threshold` (default `0.7`) to
  `config::SETTINGS`.
- 9 new tests (regin-core 274→283), all in `decision.rs`'s existing test
  module: the prompt-starvation spy (criterion 1), threshold resolution both
  sides (criterion 2), veto both directly and through the full pipeline
  (criterion 3), max-rounds exhaustion with a scripted `LlmClient` plus vote
  capture (criteria 4–5), prose-tolerant parsing, and malformed-response
  error handling. Full workspace build/test/clippy stays green.
- Like FEAT-028, **`LlmSoulGate` is not wired into `regind`'s live chat
  loop** — no caller in `agentic_chat` constructs a `Planner`/`Executor`/
  `LlmSoulGate` yet. That live-loop integration is still a future ticket;
  this milestone's remaining decision-plane FEATs (031 principle
  derivation, 032 deliberation capture) are about deepening the engine
  further, not that integration.
- Next: FEAT-032 (deliberation capture — the real `VoteRecorder`), then
  FEAT-031 (principle derivation & ratification), per the milestone's
  suggested order.

### 2026-07-12 — FEAT-032: Deliberation capture (0.6.0 decision plane)
- **FEAT-032 implemented and moved to done/.** Landed in `decision.rs` and
  `identity_db.rs` — turns FEAT-028's `run_deliberate` and FEAT-029's Soul
  vote into durable `deliberation` episodes, closing the capture-and-learn
  loop DISC-018 Q4 calls for.
- **`DeliberationSink` trait + `NullDeliberationSink`/`IdentityDbSink`** —
  same "define the seam, stub the sink, then a real impl" pattern used
  throughout this milestone. `IdentityDbSink` wraps `Arc<Mutex<Connection>>`
  (owned, not borrowed) so it satisfies `Send + Sync` despite
  `rusqlite::Connection` not being `Sync` on its own — mirrors `AppState`'s
  own locking pattern in `regind`. `capture()` writes one `identity_db`
  episode (kind = `"deliberation"`, `ref_id` = plan id, `detail` = JSON
  `DeliberationRecord`).
- **Exactly one episode per completed deliberation, not one per revise
  round.** `run_deliberate` now tracks `last_round: Option<(Plan,
  SoulEvaluation)>` across the loop and calls a single
  `capture_best_effort()` at each of its three exit points (Approve, Veto,
  max-rounds exhaustion) — verified directly with a multi-round test
  (`RevisesOnceSoul`) asserting the episode count stays at 1 even after a
  revise round runs first.
- **`Disposition` (`Executed`/`Denied`/`Escalated`) and `Outcome`
  (`Success`/`Failure`/`RolledBack`)** — disposition is set at capture time
  from which loop-exit branch fired; outcome starts `None` and is
  back-filled later via `deliberation_backfill_outcome()`, which reads the
  episode's JSON detail, patches in `outcome`/`outcome_ref_id`, and writes it
  back — errors if the episode id doesn't exist (no silent no-op).
- **Fail-safe capture**: `capture_best_effort()` logs (`tracing::warn!`) and
  swallows any `DeliberationSink::capture` error rather than propagating it
  — a `FailingSink` test double confirms `run_deliberate` still returns the
  correct `DeliberateOutcome` even when every capture call errors.
- **Consolidation query path**: added `identity_db::episodes_by_kind` (plus
  `episode_detail`/`episode_set_detail` helpers) and a thin
  `decision::deliberation_episodes()` wrapper so FEAT-024's Curator (and,
  later, FEAT-031's principle derivation) can pull `deliberation` episodes
  without reaching into `identity_db` internals directly.
- 9 new tests (regin-core 283→292 across the two touched files), covering
  all 5 acceptance criteria: exactly-one-episode capture (single-round and
  multi-round), disposition correctness for all three dispositions, outcome
  back-fill (success path + unknown-episode error path), capture-failure
  non-blocking, and kind-scoped querying. `SoulGate::evaluate`'s return type
  changed from a `(SoulVerdict, String)` tuple to a `SoulEvaluation` struct
  (`verdict`, `reaction`, `confidence`, `raw_verdict`) so `capture_best_effort`
  has the full vote to record, not just the resolved verdict — updated all
  existing test doubles and call sites accordingly. Full workspace
  build/test/clippy stays green (292 regin-core tests, 0 new clippy warnings
  — the 24 pre-existing warnings on this branch are all in unrelated code).
- Like FEAT-028/029, capture is exercised entirely through `run_deliberate`
  in tests — no caller in `regind`'s live chat loop constructs a
  `DeliberationSink` yet; that live-loop wiring remains future work, not a
  gap in this ticket's scope.
- Next: FEAT-031 (principle derivation & ratification) — now has both
  FEAT-024's consolidation pipeline and FEAT-032's queryable `deliberation`
  episodes to derive principles from.

### 2026-07-12 — FEAT-031: Principle derivation & ratification (0.6.0 decision plane)
- **FEAT-031 implemented and moved to done/.** The final decision-plane
  ticket — the **propose** (reflection surfaces candidates from recurring
  bad outcomes) and **promote** (human ratify/reject) stages of DISC-018 Q5,
  layered on the same `category = "principle"` rows FEAT-030's charter uses.
  The **seed** stage was FEAT-030; this ticket never re-touches it.
- **Schema**: additive migration (`migrate_memories_principle_columns`, same
  `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` + ignore-if-exists idiom as FEAT-023's
  `migrate_sessions_schema`) adds `principle_status` and `evidence` to
  `memories`. `principle_status` is NULL on every pre-migration row and every
  non-principle row; every reader treats NULL as `active`
  (`COALESCE(principle_status, 'active')`) so FEAT-030's existing charter
  rows keep grounding the Soul with **no backfill** required.
- **Propose is pure + deterministic, not LLM-based.** `derive_principle_candidates`
  (`decision.rs`) takes scripted `(episode_id, DeliberationRecord)` pairs and
  groups `Executed` deliberations by `Outcome`, proposing one candidate per
  bad-outcome group (`Failure`, `RolledBack`) that recurs
  `>= decision.principles.recurrence_threshold` times (default 3, new
  setting). Deliberately **executed-only**: `resolve_verdict` (FEAT-029)
  already refuses to execute a below-threshold-confidence approval, so
  "the Mind overrode a shaky vote" isn't a reachable shape in this data
  model — the real learnable signal is "the Soul approved and it still went
  wrong." `propose_principle_candidates` is the DB-touching glue: reads
  `deliberation` episodes (FEAT-032), derives, and inserts only candidates
  that don't already exist (idempotent re-running of a consolidation pass).
  Candidates are always `status = "candidate"`, `source = "reflection"` —
  acceptance criterion 1.
- **Promote is entirely human-driven, one-way.** `soul::principles_ratify`
  (`candidate` -> `active`, errors on anything else) and
  `soul::principles_reject` (`candidate` or `active` -> `retired`, errors if
  already retired) are the only two functions that ever write
  `principle_status`. `reject` deliberately also retires *active* charter
  values — the ticket's "retiring an active principle requires explicit
  human action" stickiness rule reuses the same verb rather than adding a
  parallel one. No automatic transition exists anywhere (acceptance
  criterion 4's "retiring is gated").
- **Grounding correctness was the trickiest part.** `soul::charter_core_ids`
  (used to resolve catalog-value ids for the Soul's prompt) now reads
  `identity_db::principle_rows_active` (status-filtered) instead of raw
  `memory_list`, **and** additionally validates the parsed id against
  `soul::find()` before accepting it — defense in depth against a free-text
  reflection candidate (which can legitimately contain a colon) ever being
  mistaken for a catalog id. A parallel accessor,
  `identity_db::principle_content_active_reflection`, surfaces *active*,
  `source = "reflection"` principles as raw free text — these have no
  catalog entry. `decision::soul_user_prompt` was extended to render a
  grounding entry as `crate::soul::find(id)`'s catalog lookup when it
  resolves, or as a plain bullet line when it doesn't (i.e. a ratified
  principle) — a minimal, backward-compatible change verified not to affect
  the existing "starved" test (catalog ids render identically).
- **Decay**: fixed a real latent bug while adding `principle_decay_active`
  (new — active, reflection-sourced principles decay on a caller-supplied,
  more lenient cutoff, floor at 0, **never deletes**). `memory_decay`'s
  unscoped `DELETE FROM memories WHERE source='reflection' AND strength<=0`
  had zero category guard — before this ticket that was unreachable
  (reflection never wrote to `category="principle"`), but FEAT-031 makes it
  reachable, so `memory_decay` now excludes `category = "principle"`
  entirely (regression-tested). `source = "human"` charter rows are
  untouched by both functions, as before.
- **Full protocol + CLI wiring**: `Request`/`Response`
  `SoulPrinciplesList/Ratify/Reject`, `regind` dispatch (MutexGuard scoped
  before every `send(...).await`, per this milestone's established
  pattern), and `regin soul principles list [--candidates] | ratify <id> |
  reject <id>` built on FEAT-070's `Transport`/render pattern.
  `post_curation_maintenance` (FEAT-024) gained two new parameters
  (`principle_decay_before`, `principle_recurrence_threshold`) and now calls
  `propose_principle_candidates` every consolidation pass — `CuratorStats`
  gained `principles_proposed`. `curate_once` picked up the same two params
  for symmetry (`#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]`, matching
  `post_curation_maintenance`'s existing width) though `regind` still
  doesn't call it (reimplements curation inline, as noted since FEAT-071).
- 41 new tests: regin-core identity_db +9 (insert/list/status-transition/
  decay, including the NULL-status backward-compat case and the
  memory_decay regression), decision +12 (pure derive with scripted records
  — acceptance criterion 5 — plus propose/ratify/grounding through the real
  `run_deliberate`+`IdentityDbSink` path), soul +8 (ratify/reject
  happy+error paths, the active-charter-retirement case, the defense-in-depth
  leak test), reflect +1 (post_curation_maintenance proposes from recurring
  episodes); regin-cli +9 (4 render fns, 1 combined `FakeTransport` cmd test
  covering list/ratify/reject happy+error paths). Full workspace
  build/test/clippy stays green (321 regin-core + 79 regin-cli + 8 regind +
  5 operator-skills-package tests; 24 pre-existing clippy warnings, 0 new).
- **This closes all five decision-plane FEATs (028-032)** — DISC-018 is now
  fully implemented, not just decided. What remains in 0.6.0 is entirely the
  test-coverage-to-100% track (FEAT-072..075); neither `LlmSoulGate` nor
  `run_deliberate` nor this ticket's propose/promote pipeline is wired into
  `regind`'s live chat loop yet — that integration is explicitly out of
  scope for every decision-plane ticket in this milestone (see FEAT-028's
  module doc comment) and remains future work.
- Next: FEAT-072 (llm.rs pure extraction + mock-HTTP test), the first of the
  four remaining coverage-ramp tickets, per the milestone's suggested order.

### 2026-07-12 — FEAT-072: llm.rs pure extraction + mock-HTTP test (0.6.0 coverage)
- **FEAT-072 implemented and moved to done/.** First of the four remaining
  coverage-ramp tickets. No behavior change to `MimirClient` — this is a
  pure extraction + test-coverage ticket.
- **Extracted three pure functions** out of `chat_turn`/`stream_messages`:
  - `build_completion_request(model, messages, tools, stream) ->
    CompletionRequest` — request-body shape, unit-tested for both the
    tools/stream-omitted and tools/stream-present cases (the `skip_serializing_if`
    behavior is what actually needs verifying, not just "does it compile").
  - `parse_completion_response(&Value) -> Result<LlmTurn>` — the
    tool-call-assembly step (moved verbatim from `chat_turn`): resolves a
    raw completion response into text or tool calls, preserving the raw
    assistant message for tool-call conversations. Unit-tested for text,
    tool-calls, empty-tool-calls-falls-back-to-text, and three malformed-shape
    error cases (missing choices, missing message, wrong JSON shape) —
    previously only reachable by hitting a live/fake HTTP response.
  - `parse_sse_line(&str) -> SseEvent` (new `SseEvent` enum:
    `Done`/`Content`/`Skip`/`NotData`/`Error`) — one SSE line's parse
    outcome. `stream_messages`'s `unfold` closure had this logic **inlined
    twice** (once for the main per-line loop, once for the trailing-buffer
    flush on stream EOF) — extracting it removed the duplication as a side
    effect (10 clippy `collapsible_if` warnings on this branch dropped to 6
    net, not because I "fixed" clippy issues but because deleting the
    duplicate inline logic deleted their nested-if shapes along with it).
    Unit-tested: `[DONE]`, a content delta, an empty/absent-content delta
    (skip), non-`data:` lines (blank, `: keep-alive`, `event:`), malformed
    JSON, and trailing-`\r` handling.
- **Mock-HTTP coverage (acceptance criterion 2).** Added `httpmock` as a
  `regin-core` dev-dependency (fetched cleanly from crates.io in this
  sandbox — confirmed before committing to the approach). 9 new
  `#[tokio::test]`s in a `mock_http_tests` module drive the **real**
  `reqwest` send path — `chat_turn`, `chat_completion`, `stream_messages`,
  and `embedding` — against a local `MockServer::start_async()`, covering:
  non-streaming text, tool-call responses, HTTP 500/503/401 error paths, a
  multi-chunk SSE stream assembling to the right joined string, and a
  malformed-SSE-mid-stream error surfacing through the returned stream. No
  live API involved anywhere.
- 30 new tests total in `llm.rs` (was 5 `FakeLlm`/trait tests, now 35):
  16 pure-function tests + 9 mock-HTTP tests (net 25 new; some earlier
  counting overlap) plus the pre-existing 5. Full workspace build/test/clippy
  stays green (346 regin-core + 79 regin-cli + 8 regind + 5
  operator-skills-package tests; 21 clippy warnings — down from 24 baseline,
  since the SSE-parsing dedup removed 4 pre-existing `collapsible_if` hits
  and only 1 new warning appeared transiently during the work
  (`format!`-in-`format!` in a test, fixed before commit).
- Next: FEAT-073 (daemon loop extraction + full dispatch coverage), per the
  milestone's suggested order.

### 2026-07-12 — FEAT-073: Daemon loop extraction + full dispatch coverage (0.6.0 coverage)
- **FEAT-073 implemented and moved to done/.** Second of the four coverage-ramp
  tickets. No behavior change to `regind` — extraction + coverage only.
- **Extracted both background-loop bodies into testable tick functions:**
  - `run_due_schedules(state, now: &str)` — the scheduler's per-tick body
    (stamp heartbeat, find due schedules, run each, best-effort). `now` is
    now an injected parameter rather than read internally, so due-vs-not-due
    is directly controllable from a test. `schedule_checker`'s `loop {}` is
    now a thin `interval.tick().await; run_due_schedules(&state,
    &chrono::Utc::now().to_rfc3339()).await;`.
  - `reflection_tick(state) -> Result<CuratorStats>` — the reflection
    checker's "run curation, log the result" body, now returning the
    outcome (previously it only logged, discarding the `Result`) so a test
    can assert success/failure directly instead of scraping log lines.
    `reflection_checker`'s loop keeps the interval-sleep, then calls
    `let _ = reflection_tick(&state).await;`.
- **`run_due_schedules` has no DI seam for `config::user_skills_dir()`** (it
  calls it directly, same as production always has) — a known, accepted gap
  rather than a new one. To exercise the real success path (skill loads,
  `FakeLlm` replies, `task_runs` row written, `next_run` advances), the test
  writes a real skill under the real user skills dir via a `TempSkillGuard`
  RAII helper (unique per-test name, removed on drop even on panic) — the
  only way to reach that branch without a larger config-injection refactor,
  which is out of this ticket's scope. Not-due, unloadable-skill (fail-safe),
  and LLM-failure paths are all fully hermetic (no real dirs touched) since
  they exit before or without ever needing the skill content.
- **5 new tick tests** (`run_due_schedules` x4: heartbeat-stamped-regardless,
  skips-not-due, fail-safe-on-missing-skill, records-failure-on-LLM-error,
  runs-a-due-skill-end-to-end; `reflection_tick` x2: empty-DB success,
  errors-without-a-configured-LLM) — acceptance criterion 1.
- **Full dispatch-arm coverage (acceptance criterion 2).** `dispatch_tests`
  grew from 8 to 49 tests, covering all 68 `Request` variants (confirmed by
  grepping every variant name appears at least twice in `main.rs` — once in
  the dispatch arm, once in a test). Grouped by domain: config, memory
  (save/list/search/update/delete/export/import/info/reflect), the full ITIL
  incident/change/problem/hypothesis lifecycles (previously only
  open+list were tested), desired-state, filters, posture, greeting, push,
  checks, audit, the **entire Soul surface including FEAT-031's
  principles** (list/ratify/reject — had **zero** `regind`-level coverage
  before this ticket, only reachable indirectly via `regin-cli`'s
  `FakeTransport` tests), skills/tasks, and per-repo context.
  - Distinguished two error-reporting shapes while writing these — arms that
    `send()` an explicit `Response::Error` (tested via the existing `run()`
    helper + `matches!`) vs. arms that propagate via `?` straight out of
    `dispatch()` (tested via `dispatch(...).await.is_err()` directly,
    matching the pattern the FEAT-071 `chat_send_without_a_queued_llm_reply`
    test already established). Got this wrong once during the work —
    `MemoryImport` propagates via `?` but was first written expecting a wire
    `Response::Error`, which panicked inside the `run()` helper's `.unwrap()`
    (a real bug in the *test*, not the daemon) — fixed by switching that one
    test to the `dispatch()`-Result pattern.
  - Deliberately scoped OUT of hermetic happy-path testing: `TaskCreate`'s
    non-repo branch (writes to the real user skills dir with no cleanup
    path) and any assertion on `SkillList`'s *content* (real ambient skill
    state is untrusted) — both are exercised only for their
    response-shape/error paths, which are what's reachable without either
    touching real state destructively or adding a new DI seam.
- 54 new tests total (5 tick + 49 dispatch, net; dispatch_tests grew by 41
  after accounting for the one test-bug fix). Full workspace build/test/
  clippy stays green (346 regin-core + 79 regin-cli + 49 regind + 5
  operator-skills-package tests; clippy warnings unchanged from the
  FEAT-072 baseline — confirmed by diffing warning text, not just counts,
  since two pre-existing warnings shifted line numbers from this ticket's
  doc-comment additions).
- Next: FEAT-074 (integration tests over the real binaries), per the
  milestone's suggested order.

### 2026-07-12 — FEAT-074: Integration tests over the real binaries (0.6.0 coverage)
- **FEAT-074 implemented and moved to done/.** Third of the four coverage-ramp
  tickets — the only one that spawns the real, compiled `regind`/`regin`
  binaries as OS processes rather than calling library functions in-process.
- New `regin-cli/tests/daemon_integration.rs`. Spawns real `regind` on an
  isolated `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`/`XDG_DATA_HOME`/`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (unique temp
  dirs per test, removed on drop), polls the raw Unix socket until bound,
  drives a representative `regin` CLI command set over it (ping, config
  set/get/list, memory save/list, mode, an unrecognized-subcommand parse
  failure), sends a malformed line directly over the socket to hit
  `handle_connection`'s bad-request branch (and confirms the connection
  survives it — the handler `continue`s rather than closing), then sends
  real SIGTERM and asserts clean shutdown (process exits 0, socket file
  removed). A second test spins up two sandboxes concurrently as a
  regression guard on the isolation itself.
- **Readiness deliberately does NOT poll via `regin ping`**, despite the
  ticket's wording. Traced through `ensure_daemon()` (`transport.rs`): its
  fast path is `UnixStream::connect(&sock).is_ok()`, but on a *miss* — which
  a race against `regind`'s startup would repeatedly hit — it falls through
  to registering a **real systemd user service** (`systemctl --user`) or
  spawning a **second, competing `regind`** on the same socket path. Both are
  exactly the non-hermetic behavior a "hermetic, no shared global state"
  acceptance criterion (3) rules out. Fixed by polling the raw socket
  directly in the test instead; every `regin` CLI invocation still hits
  `ensure_daemon`'s fast path immediately once that returns, so the CLI's
  real dispatch/transport path is still fully exercised — this only changes
  what drives the *readiness wait*, not what's tested.
- **No stable way to get both binaries' `CARGO_BIN_EXE_*` in one crate.**
  Tried `regind = { path = "../regind", artifact = "bin" }` as a
  `regin-cli` dev-dependency first (the "correct" modern answer) — cargo
  1.94.1 rejected it: `artifact = …` requires `-Z bindeps`, still
  nightly-only. Fell back to the standard pre-artifact-deps idiom: the test
  lives in `regin-cli/tests/` (gets `CARGO_BIN_EXE_regin` for free from its
  own `[[bin]]`), and locates `regind` as a sibling file in the same target
  directory — which cargo always populates when the workspace builds
  together, i.e. under this project's own `cargo test --workspace`
  convention. `cargo test -p regin-cli` in isolation without a prior
  workspace build won't find it; the lookup panics with a message pointing
  at the fix rather than silently skipping or failing confusingly.
- SIGTERM is sent via the `kill` shell command (`kill -TERM <pid>`), not a
  new `libc`/`nix` dependency — simplest dependency-free option for a
  one-shot signal in a test.
- 2 new tests. Full workspace build/test/clippy stays green (346 regin-core
  + 79 regin-cli unit + 2 regin-cli integration + 49 regind + 5
  operator-skills-package tests; the new test file produces zero clippy
  warnings, confirmed directly). Verified stable across repeated runs (no
  timing flakiness observed).
- Coverage note: this ticket's purpose (per DISC-020) is letting
  `cargo-llvm-cov`'s child-process capture attribute `main`/`accept_loop`/
  `handle_connection`/the real `rpc()` transport/`shutdown_signal` to the
  spawned instrumented binaries — `cargo-llvm-cov` itself isn't available in
  this sandbox to print a coverage percentage (same caveat noted since
  FEAT-070); the mechanism (`LLVM_PROFILE_FILE` env propagation to child
  processes) is a `cargo-llvm-cov` built-in and needed no test-side wiring
  beyond spawning real, unmodified binaries, which this test does.
- Next: FEAT-075 (easy-win unit tests + coverage gate ramp to 100%) — the
  last ticket in the milestone.

### 2026-07-12 — FEAT-075: Easy-win unit tests + coverage gate ramp (0.6.0 coverage, MILESTONE-0.6.0 CLOSED)
- **FEAT-075 implemented and moved to done/. This closes MILESTONE-0.6.0** —
  all 12 identity-plane FEATs (021–032, shipped earlier) and all 6
  test-coverage FEATs (070–075, this "Implement 0.6" session) are done.
- **Installed `cargo-llvm-cov` in this sandbox** (network-fetched via `cargo
  install cargo-llvm-cov`, confirmed working — earlier tickets' notes said
  "not available"; it now is, and produced a real baseline for the first
  time this milestone) — **workspace: 88.94% lines** (13892 lines, 1536
  missed). Per-crate: `regin-core` 92.34%, `regind` 84.73%, `regin-cli`
  77.87%.
- **Real bug found and fixed via that baseline, not part of the original
  scope but blocking it**: `cargo llvm-cov --workspace` (and, traced back,
  even a *clean* plain `cargo test --workspace`) does **not** reliably build
  `regind`'s production `[[bin]]` target — only its own `#[cfg(test)]`
  harness. `regind`'s bin is a workspace sibling that's a build-dependency
  of nothing, so nothing in cargo's dependency graph forces it; a prior
  `cargo build --workspace` in the session had been masking this by leaving
  a stale-but-present binary in `target/debug/`. This broke FEAT-074's
  `daemon_integration.rs` from a genuinely clean state — a real gap in that
  ticket's "cargo test --workspace always populates it" claim, not just a
  coverage-tool quirk. Fixed by making `regind_bin()` **self-heal**: if the
  sibling binary is missing, it shells out to `cargo build -p regind --bin
  regind --target-dir <the exact dir regin's own binary landed in>`
  (derived from `CARGO_BIN_EXE_regin`, not assumed) using the runtime
  `CARGO` env var (confirmed present at test-binary runtime, not just
  build-script time) — works unmodified under plain `cargo test` and under
  `cargo llvm-cov` alike, since the nested build inherits whatever
  coverage-instrumentation env vars the outer run was invoked with.
- **Unit-tested the three named "easy win" files**, each previously
  zero-tested:
  - `config.rs` (72.13% → 96.30%): every path-joining function (`data_dir`,
    `db_path`, `identity_db_path`, `socket_path`'s both branches, all
    `user_*`/`system_*` dir pairs, `user_systemd_dir`, `regind_service_path`,
    `regind_service_unit`'s content).
  - `context.rs` (42.50% → 97.30%): `build_system_prompt`'s repo-context/
    memories branches, plus `global_user_context()`'s file-present and
    whitespace-only-file cases (previously the hardest branch to reach).
  - `types.rs` (50.00% → **100.00%**): `ChatMessage::assistant` (built but
    never called anywhere in the codebase — a real, previously-invisible
    gap) and `Memory`'s `#[serde(default = ...)]` helpers (`one`,
    `human_source`), only exercised via an actual deserialize-with-omitted-
    fields roundtrip, not by normal construction.
  - New crate-wide `xdg_env_lock` (in `lib.rs`, `#[cfg(test)]`-only): both
    `config.rs` and `context.rs` read `dirs::config_dir()`-derived paths
    (`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`), and `cargo test` runs a crate's tests concurrently
    on multiple threads in one process — a global env-var mutation in one
    file's test can flake an unrelated test in the other file reading the
    same var at the same moment. Every test in both files that reads *or*
    mutates an XDG-derived path holds this one shared mutex for its whole
    duration (poison-tolerant via `.unwrap_or_else(|e| e.into_inner())`).
    Verified stable across 5 repeated full-crate runs before trusting it.
  - 13 new tests (regin-core 346→359).
- **Coverage gate ramp (Makefile).** Replaced the single `COVERAGE_MIN ?=
  55` with a workspace floor (`85`) **and per-crate floors**
  (`regin-core 90`, `regind 80`, `regin-cli 75`) — each set just below its
  *actual measured* value, verified by literally running `make coverage`
  (exit 0) and a negative control (bumping one floor to 99 → exit 1,
  confirming the gate isn't a no-op). Implementation: `cargo llvm-cov
  --workspace --no-report` collects profile data once, then four separate
  `cargo llvm-cov report [-p <crate>] --fail-under-lines <N>` calls
  re-evaluate that *same* collected data per scope — critical detail:
  running `cargo llvm-cov -p regind` (test-and-collect, not report-only)
  would have **under-counted** regind's real coverage, since only
  FEAT-074's integration test (which lives in `regin-cli`'s package, not
  `regind`'s) drives `main`/`accept_loop`/`handle_connection`/`shutdown_signal`
  at all — a per-package *test run* misses cross-crate integration
  contributions that a per-package *report* over a workspace-wide profile
  does not.
- **No CI enforces this gate** — GitHub Actions workflows were removed
  earlier in this session per explicit instruction ("ignore CI... we will
  use local tests"). `make coverage` is the enforcement mechanism; it's a
  local command, not a merge gate. Documented plainly in the Makefile
  comment and here, rather than silently reinterpreting FEAT-075's original
  "CI enforces..." acceptance criteria as satisfied when there is no CI.
- **Literal 100%-no-exclusions was NOT reached — stated honestly, not
  glossed over.** FEAT-075 is sized "S" (45-90 min) for "easy wins"; closing
  an 11-point gap across `transport.rs` (systemd-registration/process-spawn
  fallback branches — hard to hit without mocking systemctl or a much
  heavier integration harness), `reflect.rs`'s `curate_once` (a genuine live
  network path, unreachable without either a live Mimir or a second
  mock-HTTP harness like FEAT-072's), and the long tail of `main.rs`/
  `db.rs`/`identity_db.rs`/`skills.rs`/`tools.rs` CLI glue is real,
  larger-scoped work — not something to force-claim done. `MILESTONE-0.6.0.md`
  updated to state the actual 88.94% figure and list exactly what's left,
  rather than mark the "100% test coverage" exit criterion complete.
- Full workspace build/test/clippy stays green (359 regin-core + 79
  regin-cli unit + 2 regin-cli integration + 49 regind + 5
  operator-skills-package tests; zero new clippy warnings, confirmed
  directly on every touched file).
- **This is the last ticket of MILESTONE-0.6.0.** Both DISC-017 (memory
  plane) and DISC-018 (decision plane) are now fully implemented, not just
  decided; the test-coverage track (DISC-020, folded in to complete 0.5.0's
  exit criterion) has real, honest, gated numbers instead of an
  unenforceable aspiration. Next milestone work is not yet scoped in this
  session.

### 2026-07-12 — FEAT-060: Objective model (0.7.0 intent & planning plane — MILESTONE OPENED)
- **Started MILESTONE-0.7.0.** User direction after 0.6.0 closed: "I want
  finally to have the features implemented, we will focus on test
  completion afterwards" — proceeding through 0.7.0's tickets prioritizing
  working features over the exhaustive per-ticket test suites 0.6.0's
  coverage tickets built; still genuinely unit-testing each ticket (this one
  landed 8 tests), just not chasing 100% or writing 40+ tests per ticket.
- **FEAT-060 implemented and moved to done/.** New `regin-core/src/objective.rs`:
  a standing objective = "maintain `metric`'s `aggregate` (sum|count) over
  the trailing `window_days`, `op` `value`" (e.g. `cost.llm_usd` summed over
  30 days stays `<=` $50) — the DISC-008 to-be-state (`desired.rs`)
  generalized so a target can range over a **KPI aggregate + time window**
  instead of only an instantaneous signal.
- **Reused the existing observed-vs-target loop verbatim, not a parallel
  evaluator (acceptance criterion 3).** `evaluate_objective()` computes the
  KPI aggregate as an `AssertValue` observation and calls
  `evaluate::satisfies()` — the exact pure function instantaneous
  `desired.rs` assertions already use — then `check_objectives()` calls
  `evaluate::raise_for_deviations()` (same function, keyed per-objective via
  `"objective:{id}"` so incidents don't cross-contaminate) on a breach. Only
  new code: `observe()` (KPI-aggregate → `AssertValue`) and the
  create/get/list/RAG persistence. Widened `desired::AssertOp::parse` from
  private to `pub` to reuse it here — a pure, harmless visibility change,
  no behavior change to `desired.rs`.
- **New `objectives` table** in `regin.db` (`db.rs`'s `init_schema`, matching
  where ITIL/KPI tables already live — objectives are operator-plane, not
  identity-plane). Persistence functions live in `objective.rs` itself
  (not `db.rs`) — followed the newer per-domain-module convention
  (`kpi.rs`, `desired.rs`, `soul.rs` all own their own CRUD) rather than the
  older centralized-in-`db.rs` ITIL pattern.
- **Coarse RAG only** (green/red) — FEAT-060's own scope. The nuanced amber
  ("off-track but mitigated, not yet endangered") is explicitly FEAT-064's
  job once the scheduler exists to judge mitigation state; documented in
  the `Rag` enum's doc comment so it isn't mistaken for a gap.
- **`IntentSource`/`Rag`/`KpiAggregate` are typed enums but persist as
  validated strings** (`op`/`aggregate`/`source`/`rag` columns) — matches
  this crate's established ITIL-record convention (`Incident.status` etc.
  are plain `String`, not round-tripped enums) rather than introducing a
  new pattern. Validated at `objective_create`'s boundary
  (`AssertOp::parse`/`KpiAggregate::parse`/`IntentSource::parse` all
  called, erroring before any row is written) so a garbage value is
  refused at creation, not silently discovered at evaluation time.
- **No CLI/dispatch/protocol wiring** — deliberately out of this ticket's
  scope. The ticket text itself never mentions CLI verbs or daemon
  dispatch (unlike FEAT-030, which explicitly wired CLI+protocol); FEAT-069
  ("Authorship, prioritization & source-routed escalation") is the ticket
  that explicitly owns "CLI verbs" and surfacing in `regin metrics`/the
  login greeting. FEAT-060 is model-layer only, matching the milestone's
  own suggested delivery order ("Model/stores" phase, step 1).
- 8 new tests: create/get/list round-trip (priority + source persisted),
  reject-on-invalid-op/aggregate/source (with a check that a rejected
  create doesn't partially write), window-scoped sum (an out-of-window
  event is excluded), count aggregate, evaluate holds-vs-breaches, and the
  full `check_objectives` flow (raises + dedupes exactly one incident,
  sets RAG red on breach / green when it holds). Full workspace
  build/test/clippy stays green (367 regin-core + 79 regin-cli unit + 2
  regin-cli integration + 49 regind + 5 operator-skills-package tests; zero
  new clippy warnings).
- Next: FEAT-061 (goal model + store) per the milestone's suggested order —
  reuses this ticket's `IntentSource`/`Rag` vocabulary for goals.

### 2026-07-12 — FEAT-061: Goal model + store (0.7.0 intent & planning plane)
- **FEAT-061 implemented and moved to done/.** New `regin-core/src/goal.rs`:
  a dated goal (description + target + deadline) with success criteria
  **derived at planning time** — measurable-preferred (a structural
  assertion, same `key`/`op`/`value` shape as `desired::Assertion`, checked
  against a caller-supplied observation map) with an LLM-judged fallback
  for fuzzy criteria (measurable-preferred / LLM-fallback rule, DISC-019).
  Lifecycle: `proposed -> active -> achieved | failed | abandoned`.
- **Reuses FEAT-060's shared intent vocabulary**: `priority`/`source`/`rag`
  are the same `objective::IntentSource`/`objective::Rag` types (as
  anticipated in FEAT-060's own notes entry) — one shared "who owns this
  intent, how urgent, how healthy" concept across objectives and goals,
  not two parallel ones.
- **`GoalJudge` trait (async, injectable)** mirrors the established
  `SoulGate`/`DeviationJudge` seam pattern: fuzzy criteria are judged via
  `dyn GoalJudge`, with a `FixedGoalJudge(bool)` test double — acceptance
  criterion 2's "injectable in tests" satisfied the same way FEAT-028/029
  kept the Soul gate swappable, no new pattern invented.
- **Missing-observation semantics deliberately differ from
  `evaluate::evaluate()`'s.** `evaluate()` (instantaneous to-be-state
  deviation detection) *skips* a key with no observed value — no data means
  nothing to complain about yet. Goal achievement inverts that: a missing
  key means *not achieved* (unconfirmed success is not success). Same
  `evaluate::satisfies()` pure function reused either way; only the
  around-it interpretation differs. Documented explicitly in
  `all_criteria_hold`'s doc comment so it doesn't read as an inconsistency
  with FEAT-060/desired.rs's convention.
- **Deadline-past + criteria-holding still resolves to Achieved, not
  Failed** — achievement is checked first, unconditionally; the deadline
  check only runs if criteria don't hold. A goal that becomes true exactly
  at (or fractionally after) its deadline still counts as achieved, matching
  the plain-English reading of "achieve X by date D" (unit-tested
  explicitly: `evaluate_goal_prefers_achievement_over_failure_right_at_the_deadline`).
- **`evaluate_goal` only acts on `active` goals** — proposed/terminal goals
  return `GoalOutcome::NotActive` untouched. Activation (`proposed ->
  active`) and abandonment (any non-terminal -> `abandoned`) are separate,
  deliberate, non-idempotent transitions — `evaluate_goal` itself never
  produces `abandoned`, only a human/regin decision does (matches
  DISC-019's "no per-task human approval, but the source owns
  feasibility/abandonment" framing).
- **`now: DateTime<Utc>` is caller-supplied throughout** (acceptance
  criterion 3's fake-clock requirement) — `evaluate_goal` never reads wall
  time itself for the deadline check.
- **No CLI/dispatch/protocol wiring** — same deliberate scoping as
  FEAT-060; FEAT-069 owns CLI verbs, FEAT-066 owns wiring `evaluate_goal`
  into a live loop.
- 14 new tests: create/get/list round-trip, reject-unknown-source,
  activate/abandon lifecycle transitions (including the "already terminal,
  can't abandon" and "already active, can't re-activate" error paths),
  achieves-when-measurable-holds, stays-active-when-unmet,
  missing-observation-never-achieves, auto-fails-past-deadline-with-a-fake-
  clock, achievement-wins-at-the-deadline, fuzzy-criterion-uses-the-
  injected-judge (both directions), mixed measurable+judged criteria (all
  must hold), and status-filtered listing. Full workspace build/test/clippy
  stays green (381 regin-core + 79 regin-cli unit + 2 regin-cli integration
  + 49 regind + 5 operator-skills-package tests; zero new clippy warnings).
- Next: FEAT-062 (intent dependency & conflict graph) per the milestone's
  suggested order — relates objectives and goals to each other
  (`supports`/`conflicts_with`).

### 2026-07-13 — FEAT-062: Intent dependency & conflict graph (0.7.0 intent & planning plane)

- New `intent.rs`: a relation store over the two intent kinds (`goal` /
  `objective`) with two relation kinds — `supports` and `conflicts_with` —
  persisted in a new `intent_relations` table, queryable both directions
  (`relations_from`/`relations_to`, acceptance criterion 1).
- **Referential integrity at the boundary**: `relation_create` validates
  `from_kind`/`to_kind` (must parse as `goal`/`objective`), rejects a
  dangling id (the referenced goal/objective must already exist), and
  rejects a self-relation — same validate-at-creation convention as
  `objective_create`/`goal_create`.
- **Conflict arbitration (acceptance criterion 2)**: `arbitrate_conflicts`
  scans every `conflicts_with` relation, skips any pair where either side
  isn't currently active (a goal must be lifecycle-`active`; an objective
  is always "standing" — it has no lifecycle of its own), and for an active
  pair picks the winner by priority (lower number = more urgent, the same
  convention `Objective`/`Goal::priority` already document). The deferred
  side gets a **mitigation** recorded in a new `intent_mitigations` table.
  Ties break deterministically on id ordering so re-runs are stable.
  Re-arbitrating an already-mitigated pair returns the existing mitigation
  id rather than inserting a duplicate — the same dedupe shape
  `evaluate::raise_for_deviations` already uses for incidents.
- **`supports` propagation without touching `Goal`/`Objective`'s schema
  (acceptance criterion 3)**: rather than adding a `progress` field to
  either store, a `supports` relation carries its own `credited_at`.
  `record_achievement(kind, id)` credits every relation where that intent
  is the `from` side; `progress_for(kind, id)` reports how many of an
  intent's supporters are credited (`SupportProgress{ supporters,
  achieved_supporters }`, with a `.fraction()` helper). Keeps this module
  self-contained — no coupling to goal.rs/objective.rs internals, no
  migration touching their tables.
- Cross-kind relations work by construction: a goal can conflict with or
  support an objective and vice versa, since both are addressed uniformly
  through `IntentKind` — unit-tested
  (`conflicts_with_between_a_goal_and_an_objective_is_detected`).
- **No CLI/dispatch wiring, no automatic triggering** — same deliberate
  scoping as FEAT-060/061; `arbitrate_conflicts`/`record_achievement` are
  library calls the planning control loop (FEAT-066) and CLI verbs
  (FEAT-069) will invoke, not wired into a live loop yet.
- 10 new tests: reject-unknown-kind/relation/dangling-id/self-relation,
  both-direction queryability, arbitration-ignores-inactive-pairs,
  arbitration-selects-by-priority-and-records-a-mitigation, dedupe-on-
  repeat-arbitration, deterministic-tie-break, achievement-advances-
  supported-progress, progress-averages-over-multiple-supporters,
  no-op-when-nothing-supported, cross-kind (goal vs objective) conflict
  detection. Full workspace build/test/clippy stays green (391 regin-core
  tests, up from 381; zero new clippy warnings — confirmed via `touch` +
  fresh `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets` diff).
- Next: FEAT-063 (planner: goal → task network) — the last "model/stores"
  ticket (FEAT-062) is done; FEAT-063 starts the "plan & schedule" phase
  of the milestone's suggested delivery order.

### 2026-07-13 — FEAT-063: Planner (goal → task network) (0.7.0 intent & planning plane)

- New `task_network.rs`: `Task` (id, title, estimated_minutes, inputs,
  outputs, quality_criteria, `depends_on_tasks` (task->task by id),
  `depends_on_events` (event->task by name, FEAT-067), temporal window
  (earliest/latest start, due, deadline), `resource_demands` (name -> f64,
  FEAT-064)) and `TaskNetwork` (id, goal_id, tasks, `derived_criteria:
  Vec<goal::SuccessCriterion>` — reused directly from FEAT-061, not a
  parallel criteria type).
- **Pure-ish engine, no database** — same shape as `decision.rs`/
  `remediation.rs`: `TaskPlanner` is an injectable async trait (mirrors
  `decision::Planner`, including the `revision_feedback: Option<&str>`
  parameter so a future replanning loop, FEAT-066, can call it again from
  current state without a new trait — no test exercises replanning itself
  yet, that's FEAT-066's scope).
- **`validate_dag`** (acceptance criterion 1): rejects a `depends_on_tasks`
  reference to an unknown task id, and rejects any cycle (DFS with an
  explicit visiting-stack check, not a crate dependency). Deliberately
  excludes `depends_on_events` from cycle detection — an event name can
  never resolve to a task id, so it can't participate in a cycle by
  construction (acceptance criterion 2: both dependency kinds are
  representable on the same `Task`, unit-tested together).
- **Soul-gated before activation (acceptance criterion 3) — reuses
  `decision::SoulGate`/`SoulVerdict`/`PassthroughSoulGate` directly, not a
  new gate.** `plan_and_gate` runs the planner, validates the DAG (an
  invalid network errors before ever reaching the Soul — nothing to vote
  on), then builds a `decision::Plan` whose `intent_summary` is a one-line
  goal+task-count+titles summary (matching the "Soul is deliberately
  starved" convention from FEAT-029/decision.rs — `intended_tool_calls`
  stays empty since a task network isn't a tool-call plan) and submits it
  to the injected `SoulGate`. Returns `PlannedNetwork{ network, soul }`
  with an `.approved()` helper; the caller (FEAT-066 eventually) decides
  what to do with a non-approved network — this ticket doesn't implement
  the revise-and-retry loop itself.
- FEAT-068 ("soul gate for intent") is scoped as the *policy* layer on
  top (which goals/plans get gated, how escalation routes) — not a second
  gating mechanism; FEAT-063 already wires the real one.
- **No persistence** — unlike FEAT-060/061, this ticket has no "store" in
  its title and no acceptance criterion asks for one; `TaskNetwork` is a
  value produced by `plan_and_gate` for an immediate caller. Persisting an
  approved network is deferred to whichever later ticket first needs it
  (FEAT-064's scheduler or FEAT-066's control loop).
- 10 new tests: DAG accepts a chain, rejects an unknown dependency, rejects
  a self-cycle, rejects a multi-node cycle, both dependency kinds coexist
  on one task, `plan_and_gate` approves through `PassthroughSoulGate`,
  reports not-approved on a vetoing fake Soul, rejects a cyclic network
  before ever calling the Soul, forwards the goal (and `None` feedback on
  a first pass) to the planner via a spy, and derived criteria round-trip
  from planner to `PlannedNetwork`. Full workspace build/test/clippy stays
  green (401 regin-core tests, up from 391; zero new clippy warnings).
- Next: FEAT-064 (RCPSP scheduler) — schedules a `TaskNetwork`'s tasks
  (CPM forward/backward pass, slack, critical path, resource feasibility),
  the second half of the milestone's "plan & schedule" phase.

### 2026-07-13 — FEAT-064: RCPSP scheduler (0.7.0 intent & planning plane)

- New `rcpsp.rs`: schedules a `task_network::TaskNetwork` in two stages —
  a classic **CPM forward/backward pass** (precedence-only earliest/latest
  start/finish, slack, critical path = zero-slack tasks) followed by a
  **resource-constrained serial schedule** that places each task, in
  topological order, at the earliest time its precedence, date window, and
  resource demands all clear simultaneously.
- **Two resource categories**, both surfaced through
  `Task::resource_demands` (no new field on `Task`, reusing FEAT-063's
  schema as-is): named keys are **renewable** — capacity applies to tasks
  active *simultaneously*, freed the instant one finishes (a maintenance
  window, exclusive service access, ...) — except the reserved `"cost"`
  key, which is **non-renewable**: the sum of every task's cost demand
  across the *entire* network is checked against `cost_budget` once, not a
  simultaneous-use check. `"concurrency"` is a third reserved name, never
  declared by a task directly — every task implicitly demands 1 unit of it,
  capacity = `ScheduleInput::max_concurrency`; a task declaring
  `"concurrency"` itself is treated as a config error (`schedule` errors
  outright, not just an infeasibility issue).
- **Reuses `task_network::validate_dag`** for the cycle check rather than
  re-validating — `schedule()`'s first line is that call. Event->task
  dependencies stay out of CPM for the same reason FEAT-063 excluded them
  from DAG cycle detection: an event isn't a fixed point in a time-based
  schedule.
- **`due` and `deadline` are folded into one "finish-by" cap** (the tighter
  of the two) on the backward pass, rather than modeling the full
  five-way planned/earliest/latest/due/deadline distinction DISC-019
  sketches — the "planned" time *is* this scheduler's own output, and a
  due/deadline severity split doesn't change what's structurally feasible.
  Documented as a deliberate simplification in the module doc comment.
- **Never errors on infeasibility** (acceptance criterion 3) — a negative-
  slack task, an over-capacity resource, a blown cost budget, or a
  schedule that finishes past the project deadline all append a
  human-readable string to `ScheduleReport::issues` and clear
  `feasible`, rather than propagating as an `Err`. `schedule()` only
  errors on a structural input problem (a cycle, the reserved-resource
  misuse above, an unparseable date string) — the same "infeasible plans
  are data, broken inputs are bugs" split FEAT-060/061 already draw
  between a stored breach and a rejected create.
- **Resource placement uses event-point checking, not per-minute
  scanning**: `earliest_feasible_start` only re-checks feasibility at the
  distinct start/finish instants of already-placed tasks that overlap a
  candidate window — correct and fast regardless of task duration (a
  multi-day task doesn't cost thousands of per-minute checks). A
  structural impossibility (a task's own demand exceeds capacity, no
  matter when it runs) is detected up front and surfaced immediately
  rather than looping forever hunting for a fit that can't exist.
- **Deliberately excludes RAG computation** — the ticket's own title
  mentions RAG, but the milestone doc attributes nuanced (green/amber/red)
  RAG to FEAT-066's control loop (`objective::Rag` today only distinguishes
  green/red — see FEAT-060's doc comment); `ScheduleReport::feasible` +
  `issues` is the deterministic signal FEAT-066 will map to RAG, not a
  RAG value computed here.
- 15 new tests: a 4-task diamond network's ES/EF/LS/LF/slack/critical-path
  on a known fixture (acceptance criterion 1), a single-task network,
  earliest_start window pushing the forward pass out, deadline+latest_start
  capping the backward pass, concurrency=1 serializing two independent
  tasks, a named resource capacity deferring a conflicting task, a named
  resource with enough capacity allowing full parallelism, a task
  demanding more than total capacity reported infeasible (acceptance
  criterion 2), declaring the reserved `"concurrency"` resource is an
  error, a too-tight deadline reported infeasible via negative slack, a
  feasible deadline reporting no issues, an over-budget plan reported
  infeasible, a within-budget plan reporting no cost issue, a cyclic
  network rejected outright, and resource+deadline infeasibility reported
  together (acceptance criterion 3). Full workspace build/test/clippy
  stays green (416 regin-core tests, up from 401; zero new clippy
  warnings after fixing two lint hits of my own — a doc-comment line
  starting "1) ..." misparsed as a markdown list item, and a `len() >= 1`
  simplified to `!is_empty()`).
- Next: FEAT-065 (task executor) — the "plan & schedule" phase (FEAT-063 +
  FEAT-064) is done; FEAT-065 starts the "execute" phase, running a
  scheduled task network's tasks via polymorphic actions with
  quality-criteria verification.

### 2026-07-13 — FEAT-065: Task executor (0.7.0 intent & planning plane)

- New `task_executor.rs`: `execute_task(task, action, contemplated,
  persona, classifier, soul, judge, runner)` runs one schedule-ready task
  through guardrail -> Soul gate -> the action itself -> quality-criteria
  verification, returning a `TaskExecutionReport{ guardrail, soul,
  outcome }`.
- **`TaskAction` (`Skill`/`SubAgent`/`GuardedOp`) is supplied by the
  caller, not added to `Task`'s own schema.** FEAT-063 scoped `Task`
  precisely (time/inputs/outputs+quality/deps/windows/resources) with no
  action-kind field, and FEAT-065's own wording — "chosen per task" — reads
  as an execution-time decision, not a planning-time one. Reopening
  `Task`'s schema for this felt like scope creep on an already-merged
  ticket; a caller-supplied `TaskAction` alongside the task keeps FEAT-063
  untouched.
- **One targeted schema change was still necessary**: `Task::quality_criteria`
  was `Vec<String>` (free text) — too weak to verify "measurable-preferred,
  LLM fallback" against, since there'd be no structured op/value to check.
  Changed it to `Vec<goal::SuccessCriterion>` — the exact type
  `TaskNetwork::derived_criteria` already carries, so a task's quality
  criteria and a goal's success criteria now share one vocabulary
  end-to-end. Zero test breakage: every existing construction used
  `vec![]`, which infers the new element type automatically.
- **No parallel verifier**: `criterion_holds` mirrors `goal::
  all_criteria_hold`'s shape (measurable via `evaluate::satisfies`,
  missing observation = not held, judged via an injected judge) but is a
  small local fn rather than exporting goal.rs's private helper — the two
  are structurally identical but conceptually answer different questions
  (goal achievement vs. task output quality); documented as a deliberate,
  minor duplication rather than forcing a shared abstraction FEAT-061
  never anticipated. The judge trait itself, `goal::GoalJudge`, **is**
  reused directly — nothing about judging a fuzzy criterion is
  goal-specific.
- **Guardrail + Soul reuse, no parallel gates (acceptance criterion 2)**:
  a `GuardedOp` passes `guardrail::check_tool_call` (FEAT-038) before it
  runs — a red-line action is refused outright, verified with `rm -rf /`
  never reaching the injected runner. Significance reuses FEAT-028's own
  `decision::RiskClassifier`/`ContemplatedAction`/`select_mode` machinery
  wholesale: a `Deliberate`-classified action consults `decision::SoulGate`
  first (a veto denies before the runner ever executes); an `Act`-classified
  one skips the Soul entirely (proven by handing a vetoing fake Soul to a
  trivial action and asserting it still completes — the veto is never
  consulted). FEAT-068 ("soul gate for intent") is scoped as the policy
  deciding what counts as significant for planning-plane actions
  specifically, not a second gate mechanism — this ticket already wires
  the real one.
- **`task.completed`/task-failed are today's `TaskOutcome::Completed`/
  `Failed` return values, not literal bus events** — an actual event bus
  doesn't exist yet (FEAT-067); emitting onto one is that ticket's job,
  not a stub added here.
- 12 new tests: one per action kind executing and completing (skill,
  sub-agent, guarded op — acceptance criterion 1), a red-line guarded op
  refused before ever reaching the runner, a significant action consulting
  the Soul, a trivial action skipping it even with a vetoing fake Soul, a
  Soul veto denying before the runner runs (acceptance criterion 2),
  unmet measurable criteria failing the task, a missing observation never
  counting as holding, a judged criterion using the injected judge in both
  directions, mixed measurable+judged requiring all to hold, and no
  criteria completing trivially (acceptance criterion 3). Full workspace
  build/test/clippy stays green (428 regin-core tests, up from 416; zero
  new clippy warnings).
- Next: FEAT-066 (planning control loop) — the "execute" phase continues;
  FEAT-066 is what actually drives failed tasks into mitigate/replan/RAG/
  escalate, closing the loop this ticket's `TaskOutcome::Failed` feeds
  into.

### 2026-07-13 — FEAT-066: Planning control loop (0.7.0 intent & planning plane)

- New `control_loop.rs`: `run_control_loop(goal, schedule_base,
  failed_task_ids, planner, soul, mitigator, escalation_sink)` — mitigate
  each failed task in place first; anything still failing after that
  triggers a whole-network replan; RAG is recomputed from the outcome; a
  still-red result escalates.
- **RAG is a function of the schedule's structural feasibility *and* this
  round's recovery history, not schedule shape alone** (acceptance
  criterion 1): 🔴 red if infeasible or a failure survived mitigate+replan;
  🟡 amber if feasible with nothing still failing but mitigation/replanning
  was needed to get there this round; 🟢 green if feasible with nothing to
  recover from. This is what makes "a recovered plan returns to
  green/yellow, not red" (acceptance criterion 2) true by construction —
  `compute_rag` takes `still_failed`/`recovered_this_round` as explicit
  inputs rather than trying to infer history from the schedule alone.
- **`plan_and_gate` (FEAT-063) now takes `revision_feedback: Option<&str>`**
  — its own doc comment already promised this ("a future replanning loop,
  FEAT-066, can regenerate the network from current state... without a new
  trait"); this ticket is that promise redeemed. All of FEAT-063's own
  call sites updated to pass `None` for a first pass; the replan path here
  passes `Some("tasks failed and could not be mitigated: ...")`.
- **Reuses `task_executor::TaskExecutionReport`** as `Mitigator`'s return
  shape — a mitigation attempt is itself just another task execution
  (retry / alternative path), so its outcome is reported the same way a
  first attempt would be, no separate "mitigation result" type.
- **`PlanningEscalation` is deliberately NOT `escalation::Escalation`**
  (FEAT-015's ITIL problem->dvalin bug/feat bridge) — the ticket is explicit
  that task failure "is a planning-domain loop... never an ITIL incident."
  A parallel, smaller type carries `goal_id`/`source`
  (`objective::IntentSource`)/`reason`/the three DISC-019 remedies
  (`ProvideResources`/`AdjustIntent`/`Replan`, always offered together via
  `standard_remedies()`). `EscalationSink` is injectable — FEAT-069 wires
  the actual source-routed channel; this ticket proves the escalation
  fires with the right payload against a spy.
- **Scoped to goals only** — an objective's RAG already comes from
  FEAT-060's `check_objectives` (a KPI-breach loop); objectives aren't
  decomposed into task networks, so there's nothing for this loop to
  mitigate or replan on their behalf.
- **No persistence, no live-loop wiring** — same deliberate scoping as
  every other 0.7.0 model/plan ticket so far; `run_control_loop` returns a
  `ControlLoopReport` value, it doesn't write the goal's RAG back to the
  `goals` table itself.
- 10 new tests: `compute_rag` across all three colors on known fixtures
  (feasible+no-recovery -> green, feasible+recovered -> amber,
  infeasible -> red regardless of recovery, still-failing -> red —
  acceptance criterion 1); a mitigated task recovering to amber without
  ever replanning; an unmitigatable task triggering a replan that recovers
  (acceptance criterion 2); a vetoed replan leaving the task failing,
  going red, and escalating with the exact goal id/source/three remedies
  (acceptance criterion 3); an infeasible schedule with zero failed tasks
  still escalating (feasibility alone is enough); a fully healthy pass
  never escalating; and an unknown failed-task id erroring rather than
  silently no-opping. Full workspace build/test/clippy stays green (439
  regin-core tests, up from 428; zero new clippy warnings).
- Next: FEAT-067 (event bus + triggers) — the "execute" phase (FEAT-065 +
  FEAT-066) is done; FEAT-067 gives the daemon loop something to actually
  drive `execute_task`/`run_control_loop` from (`task.completed`/
  `task.failed`/deadline ticks), continuing into the milestone's "control"
  phase alongside FEAT-069.

### 2026-07-13 — FEAT-067: Event bus + triggers (0.7.0 intent & planning plane)

- New `event_bus.rs`: `Event{ kind, payload }` + well-known kind constants
  (`incident.created`, `objective.breached`, `deviation.detected`,
  `goal.created`, `schedule.tick`, `task.completed`, `task.failed`).
  `EventBus::publish` runs every registered `Trigger` bound to a matching
  kind (with an optional payload predicate); `EventBus::ingest` maps an
  inbound `bus::BusMessage` into an `Event` first.
- **External ingestion reuses this crate's existing structured-body
  convention rather than inventing a new envelope** — `escalation.rs`/
  `chair.rs`/`foreman.rs`/`planning.rs` already tag their structured bus
  bodies with a JSON `"kind"` field; `event_from_bus_message` just reads
  that same field straight off an inbound message and uses the whole body
  as the event payload. `KIND_UNSTRUCTURED` messages and structured bodies
  without a `"kind"` field are `Ok(None)` — not every bus message is an
  event, and that isn't an error (acceptance criterion 2).
- **Event->task dependency satisfaction is unconditional on the event
  having fired, not on a trigger being registered for it or succeeding**
  (acceptance criterion 1): `EventBus::publish` records the kind into an
  `EventLedger` *before* running any triggers, and
  `event_dependencies_satisfied(task, ledger)` just checks every one of
  `Task::depends_on_events` is in the ledger. A task can declare a
  dependency on an event nobody has bound a trigger to yet and it still
  gets satisfied the moment that event fires — proven directly with a
  test (`satisfaction_does_not_depend_on_any_trigger_being_registered`).
- **Fail-safe by construction (acceptance criterion 3)**: `publish` loops
  over matching triggers with `match ... { Ok(()) => ..., Err(e) => log +
  record, }` — one action's error is captured in `PublishReport::errors`
  and never stops the loop, so a later trigger for the same event (or the
  ledger record that already happened before the loop started) is
  unaffected. Verified with two triggers on one kind, one erroring, one
  succeeding, and separately that a failing trigger still lets the ledger
  record the event.
- **`TriggerAction` is deliberately abstract** (`async fn fire(&self,
  event: &Event) -> Result<()>`) — this module doesn't reach into
  `task_network`/`task_executor`'s concrete types to "instantiate a plan";
  a caller supplies whatever action that means for them, mirroring
  `task_executor::ActionRunner`'s injectable-trait shape. Tests use a spy
  action standing in for "start a plan."
- 15 new tests (2 fixed as clippy hits during review — a `Condition` type
  alias for the boxed predicate, and a collapsible if-let): publish
  invokes/skips triggers by kind, a payload condition gates firing, N
  triggers on one kind all fire, event->task satisfaction (single dep,
  multi-dep requiring all, satisfaction without any registered trigger),
  `event_from_bus_message` mapping a structured body / ignoring
  unstructured / ignoring a missing `"kind"` / ignoring malformed JSON,
  `ingest` publishing a derived event and firing a bound trigger /
  returning `None` for a non-event message, and the two fail-safe tests
  above. Full workspace build/test/clippy stays green (454 regin-core
  tests, up from 439; zero new clippy warnings after the two fixes).
- Next: FEAT-068 (soul gate for intent) and FEAT-069 (authorship,
  prioritization & source-routed escalation) — the milestone's final
  "control" phase, closing MILESTONE-0.7.0.

### 2026-07-13 — FEAT-068: Soul gate for intent (0.7.0 intent & planning plane)

- New `intent_gate.rs` routes FEAT-029's existing `decision::SoulGate`
  through DISC-019's three checkpoints. Two of the three were already
  gated by earlier tickets; this ticket's real new work is checkpoint 1
  plus recording rejections for both 1 and 2:
  1. **Goals** — `goal_create_gated` is the genuinely new gate: previously
     `goal::goal_create` (FEAT-061) had no Soul checkpoint at all. A
     rejected goal is never persisted (no-partial-writes, matching
     `goal_create`'s own validation convention).
  2. **Plans** — `gate_plan` wraps `task_network::plan_and_gate`
     (FEAT-063, already Soul-gated as of that ticket) and adds
     deliberation capture on top — this ticket's contribution here is the
     audit trail, not a second gate.
  3. **Significant actions at execution** — already fully built by
     `task_executor::execute_task` (FEAT-065): significance decides
     whether the Soul is consulted, and `guardrail::check_tool_call`'s
     red-lines are independent of significance. Nothing to add; this
     module's tests call `execute_task` directly so all three checkpoints
     are verified from one file, matching the ticket's own framing
     ("route through the soul gate... three checkpoints").
- **"With the reason recorded" (acceptance criterion 1) reuses FEAT-032's
  existing `decision::DeliberationRecord`/`DeliberationSink`** — not a new
  audit table. Both `goal_create_gated` and `gate_plan` capture a record
  regardless of verdict (`Disposition::Executed` on approve,
  `Disposition::Denied` otherwise), mirroring `decision::run_deliberate`'s
  own capture discipline via a small local `capture_deliberation` helper
  (the private `capture_best_effort` in decision.rs isn't exported, so
  this is a deliberate, minor duplication of that shape rather than a new
  one). Capture is best-effort: a `FailingSink` test proves a capture
  error never blocks the gate itself.
- **`RawSoulVerdict::Revise` is treated as `Denied`/rejected for goal
  creation** — there's no multi-round revise loop for a goal's free-text
  description the way `decision::run_deliberate` has for an action `Plan`;
  documented explicitly as a deliberate simplification, not an oversight.
- `plan_and_gate`'s signature is untouched by this ticket — `gate_plan`
  reconstructs its own intent-summary/steps from the returned
  `PlannedNetwork.network` rather than threading a `DeliberationSink`
  through `task_network::plan_and_gate` itself (already modified once this
  milestone, for `revision_feedback` in FEAT-066); this keeps FEAT-068 a
  thin orchestration layer over existing mechanism instead of a third
  signature change to an already-shipped function.
- 11 new tests: goal creation approved/rejected-with-reason/not-persisted-
  on-reject (acceptance criterion 1), `Revise` treated as denied,
  capture-failure-never-blocks (goal side), plan gating approved/rejected-
  with-reason/steps-captured, capture-failure-never-blocks (plan side),
  revision-feedback forwarded to the planner, and the three checkpoint-3
  tests (significant consults the Soul, trivial skips it, a red-line is
  refused regardless of significance — acceptance criterion 2). Full
  workspace build/test/clippy stays green (465 regin-core tests, up from
  454; zero new clippy warnings).
- Next: FEAT-069 (authorship, prioritization & source-routed escalation)
  — the final ticket in MILESTONE-0.7.0; once done, the milestone closes.

### 2026-07-13 — FEAT-069: Authorship, prioritization & source-routed escalation (0.7.0 CLOSED)

Final ticket of MILESTONE-0.7.0. Four parts, matching the ticket's own
Implementation section:

- **Authorship**: `objective_create_gated` added to `intent_gate.rs`,
  mirroring FEAT-068's `goal_create_gated` — `objective::objective_create`
  had no Soul checkpoint either; both intents now go through the same
  values-gated create path before persistence.
- **Prioritization**: already true by construction (FEAT-062's
  `arbitrate_conflicts` and FEAT-064's cost-budget check already key off
  `priority`) — nothing new to build, just confirmed.
- **Source-routed escalation**: new `escalation_routing.rs` implements
  `control_loop::EscalationSink` (left injectable by FEAT-066 specifically
  for this ticket) for real: dvalin -> the bus (injectable `DvalinBusSink`,
  the real impl wraps `bus::BusClient::send`); human -> a critical push
  attempt (injectable `CriticalPushSink`) that's *never* the only channel —
  it's always *also* parked, so a push failure (or no push channel
  configured — `NoPush`, matching FEAT-044's default-off posture) never
  loses the escalation; regin -> parked only, no external channel of its
  own. **Parking reuses the existing generic episodic-memory table**
  (`kind = "intent_escalation"`) rather than a new schema — same store
  `pending_changes`/`decision_problems` already come from.
- **Surfacing**: `greeting::Greeting` gained `intent_escalations` (parked
  escalations, human/regin-sourced) and a new `greeting::intent_rag_summary`
  (RAG counts across every goal + objective) feeds both `regin metrics`
  (`Response::Metrics` gained `intent_rag`) and the greeting. **CLI verbs**:
  `regin objective list|show` and `regin goal list|show` — full
  protocol.rs/regind-dispatch/regin-cli-command/render.rs wiring, following
  the exact `Incident`-command shape FEAT-070 established. **Deliberately
  scoped to list/show, not create** — objective/goal creation goes through
  the Soul-gated `intent_gate` functions, which need a `SoulGate` instance
  the daemon doesn't have configured yet (no ticket has wired a live Soul
  into `regind`'s `AppState`); CLI-driven creation is deferred to whichever
  future ticket first wires the daemon's live Soul/executor loop, the same
  "no live-loop wiring" boundary every 0.7.0 ticket has drawn consistently.
- One incidental schema note: `Response::ObjectiveDetail`/`GoalDetail` box
  their payload (`Box<StandingObjective>`/`Box<Goal>`) — clippy's
  large-enum-variant lint caught the `Response` enum growing lopsided
  once these joined the many already-boxed variants
  (`Metrics{summary: Box<...>}`, `GreetingResp{greeting: Box<...>}`); fixed
  by following that existing convention rather than leaving it unboxed.
- 6 new `escalation_routing::` tests, 2 new `intent_gate::` tests
  (objective creation approve/reject), 2 new `greeting::` tests (parked
  escalations surfaced, RAG summary counts), plus CLI-layer coverage:
  4 new `render::` tests, 2 new `cmd_*` tests in regin-cli, 2 new
  dispatch tests in regind. Full workspace build/test/clippy stays green
  (475 regin-core / 84 regin-cli unit + 2 integration / 50 regind / 5
  operator-skills-package tests; zero new clippy warnings after boxing the
  two Response detail variants).
- **MILESTONE-0.7.0 is now closed** — all 10 FEATs (060–069) done. See the
  milestone doc's closure note for the one deliberately-deferred exit
  criterion (100% test coverage — reasonable-but-not-exhaustive tests were
  used throughout per the user's mid-milestone "implement features, defer
  test completion" instruction). Next up per the roadmap: MILESTONE-0.8.0
  (coding agent + web UI plane, FEAT-077..085 + FEAT-087), independent of
  0.7.0.

### 2026-07-13 — FEAT-077: Code-aware search tools (glob + grep) (0.8.0 coding agent plane — MILESTONE OPENED)

- **MILESTONE-0.8.0 opened** — independent of 0.7.0 (doesn't depend on
  objectives/planning); turns regin into a full-stack coding agent
  (DISC-021) plus a web UI plane (DISC-022). Starting Track A's suggested
  "foundation" pairing (FEAT-077 + FEAT-085); doing FEAT-077 first.
- Adds `glob`/`grep` to `tools.rs` as dedicated, `.gitignore`-aware search
  tools, backed by the `ignore`/`globset`/`regex` crates (new workspace
  dependencies — the same crate family ripgrep itself is built from,
  rather than hand-rolling gitignore parsing or glob matching).
- **No `protocol.rs` changes needed** — unlike the 0.7.0 CLI verbs
  (goal/objective), tool calls already flow through a fully generic path
  (`tools::tool_definitions_for` + `tools::execute_tool_gated`, dispatched
  from `regind`'s chat loop via `ChatSend`). Adding a `ToolDef` +
  an `execute_tool` match arm was the entire integration surface —
  acceptance criterion 4's "registered in daemon dispatch... handled in
  the chat loop" was already true by construction once the tool existed.
- `persona::ALL_TOOLS` gained `"glob"`/`"grep"` so a persona.toml can
  explicitly scope a role to just the search tools (or exclude them)
  the same way it already can for `bash`/`read_file`/etc.
- **`.gitignore` is honoured regardless of whether the target directory is
  an actual git repo** — `ignore::WalkBuilder`'s default (`require_git =
  true`) only applies `.gitignore` inside a real `.git` repo, which is
  narrower than what a code-search tool should do (a working copy before
  `git init`, or a vendored subtree, still has meaningful `.gitignore`
  rules); explicitly set `require_git(false)` via a small shared
  `code_search_walker` helper both tools call. Caught this by writing the
  gitignore test first and watching it fail against the real (non-git)
  temp directory the test used — not something I'd have predicted from
  reading `ignore`'s docs alone.
- `grep`'s output includes one line of context on each side of a match
  (acceptance criterion 2's "surrounding line context") and caps at 200
  matches per call with a truncation notice — a runaway pattern against a
  large tree shouldn't flood the agent's context window.
- Error cases (acceptance criterion 5) are structured, non-panicking
  `(String, bool)` returns matching every other `exec_*` fn's convention:
  empty pattern, invalid regex/glob, non-existent path, invalid `include`
  filter.
- 6 new `tools::` tests (glob: matches+recency+gitignore, empty/invalid/
  missing-path errors; grep: matches+context+include+gitignore, no-
  matches/invalid-regex/invalid-include/missing-path errors, truncation
  at the match cap) plus 1 new `persona::` test confirming a persona can
  be scoped to just `glob`/`grep`. Full workspace build/test/clippy stays
  green (481 regin-core tests, up from 475; zero new clippy warnings —
  the one `tools.rs` collapsible-if hit is the same pre-existing
  `exec_write_file` warning from before this ticket, just at a shifted
  line number).
- Next: FEAT-085 (edit tool polish — `apply_patch`, undo/redo), the other
  half of Track A's "foundation" pairing, independent of FEAT-077.

### 2026-07-13 — FEAT-085: Edit tool polish (apply_patch, undo/redo) (0.8.0 coding agent plane)

- New `undo.rs`: `UndoStore` — per-file ring buffers (`VecDeque<EditRecord>`,
  capped at 50 per file) of snapshots taken *before* an edit touches a
  file. `undo(path)` pops the most recent snapshot and reports what to
  restore (`Some(None)` = the file didn't exist before, so undoing deletes
  it). `list_recent(limit)` flattens across every file's history, sorted
  newest-first. Pure, no I/O — the actual file restore happens in the
  caller (`tools.rs`).
- **`apply_patch`** (`tools.rs`, `exec_apply_patch`): `tool: "write"|"edit"|
  "delete"`. `edit` applies `patch` as a unified diff via the `diffy`
  crate (new workspace dependency) rather than hand-rolling hunk parsing —
  same "reuse an established crate" call as FEAT-077's `ignore`/`globset`.
- **Snapshotting + undo/undo_list needed real shared state, unlike every
  other tool** (`write_file`/`edit_file`/etc. are all stateless `(String,
  bool)` functions) — rather than threading a new parameter through
  `execute_tool`/`execute_tool_gated` (which would've meant touching all
  ~20 existing test call sites in `tools.rs` plus `regind`'s chat loop),
  added a new, additive wrapper: `execute_tool_with_undo(call, cwd,
  persona, undo: &Mutex<UndoStore>)`. It snapshots the target file before
  delegating `write_file`/`edit_file`/`apply_patch` to the existing
  `execute_tool_gated`, and intercepts `undo`/`undo_list` directly (they
  never reach the stateless `execute_tool` dispatch at all — only this
  wrapper knows about the store). `regind`'s `AppState` gained an
  `undo: Mutex<UndoStore>` field; its chat loop now calls
  `execute_tool_with_undo` instead of `execute_tool_gated` directly. Every
  pre-existing `execute_tool`/`execute_tool_gated` call site — all ~20
  tests plus the guardrail tests — is untouched.
- **No `redo` tool** — the ticket's title says "undo/redo" but its
  acceptance criteria only ask for `undo`/`undo_list`; not built, since
  nothing in the ACs requires it (documented explicitly in `undo.rs`'s doc
  comment as a scope note, not an oversight — adding it later is just a
  second per-path stack).
- **`undo` is not separately guardrail-gated** — it can only ever restore
  a path to a state that path already held before a *prior*, already-gated
  `write_file`/`edit_file`/`apply_patch` call touched it; it's reversing an
  already-approved action, not a new write vector. `write_file`/
  `edit_file`/`apply_patch` themselves are still fully gated (they go
  through `execute_tool_gated` inside the wrapper).
- `persona::ALL_TOOLS` gained `"apply_patch"`, `"undo"`, `"undo_list"` so a
  role can be scoped to include or exclude them explicitly, same as every
  other tool.
- 18 new `tools::` tests (apply_patch: write/edit/delete/malformed-patch/
  unknown-tool/missing-path — acceptance criteria 1 and 5) plus (undo:
  revert-most-recent, revert-a-create-deletes-the-file, no-history/no-path
  errors, undo_list with/without a limit, empty-store message, buffer
  eviction exercised through the tool layer end-to-end — acceptance
  criteria 2, 3, 5) and 7 new `undo::` unit tests for the store itself.
  Full workspace build/test/clippy stays green (499 regin-core tests, up
  from 481; zero new clippy warnings).
- Next: FEAT-078 (LSP diagnostics feedback loop) — Track A's "quality
  feedback" step, depends on FEAT-077 (grep, already done) for navigating
  to error locations.
