# regin — agent notes

This file is the agent's scratch space: decisions, quirks, constraints, and
open questions discovered while working. It is **never overwritten by the
toolchain**. Read it at the start of every session; append to it at the end.

## How to use this file
- Append new findings under a dated heading; never silently rewrite history.
- Record *why* a non-obvious decision was made, not just *what*.
- Park deferred work as a ticket in `.repo/project/issues/`, then note it here.

## Project quick facts
- Rust workspace, edition 2024: `regin-core` (lib), `regind` (daemon), `regin-cli` (`regin` binary).
- Thin-client CLI ↔ `regind` daemon over a Unix socket; daemon auto-starts on first use.
- All state in SQLite (`<XDG_DATA_DIR>/regin/regin.db`). **No config files** — `regin config set ...`.
- LLM access is via the NanoGPT API; the CLI holds no LLM logic.
- Tools available to the agent loop: `bash`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `web_search`.
- Skills resolve user-over-system: `~/.config/regin/skills/` overrides `/usr/share/regin/skills/`.
- Chat loads per-repo context from `.repo/regin/context.md` (cwd) plus saved memories.

## Methodology
- This repo follows the V-Model methodology in `.repo/project/skills/`. Start at
  [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) and the profile at `.repo/project/profile.md`.
- Tickets live under `.repo/project/issues/` (FEAT / BUG / DISC / AUDT). One
  ticket → one PR → one merge commit.

## Open questions / watch-list
- README's "CLI Commands" table is **out of date** vs. the actual clap surface in
  `regin-cli/src/main.rs` (e.g. it lists `regin skill ...` but the verb is
  `regin task ...`, and omits `memory` / `ping`). Reconcile when touching docs.

### 2026-06-17 — methodology install
- Ported the dvalin V-Model methodology into this repo: `AGENTS.md`,
  `.repo/project/skills/` (canonical, verbatim), `.repo/project/audit/rules/`,
  an empty `.repo/project/issues/` ticket scaffold, and a regin-specific
  `.repo/project/profile.md`. No dvalin work-tickets were copied.
